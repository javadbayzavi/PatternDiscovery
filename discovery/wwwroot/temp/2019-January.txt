Hi Core Developers,

First thing: I am *not* a CPython committer.  I think most of you who are
will be somewhat familiar with me though.

Second: I was a Director of the PSF for a long while, and continue to chair
some Working Groups.  I've been mentioned in some PEPs.  I have written a
lot of articles and have given a lot of talks about Python, including about
recent or pending PEPs and similar matters.  I continue to work and train
around Python and open source (now with a focus on "data science", whatever
that is).

Third: I follow python-ideas and python-dev rather closely, and fairly
often contribute ideas to those lists.

Fourth: As I read PEP 8016, I cannot nominate myself to the Steering
Committee.  That seems good and proper to me.  But I believe I would be a
relevant and helpful member of the future Steering Committee if someone
wishes to nominate me and if the voters wish to elect me.

Thanks, David Mertz...

The primary question I would ask an external candidate is: how is it
that you never became a core developer (which implies some amount of
effort and dedication) but nevertheless would be willing to spend the
effort and dedication needed for serving on a Steering Council (*)?

(*) (or Committee, I don't remember :-))

Regards

Antoine.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Return type of datetime subclasses added to timedelta
Message-ID: <1059740e-cc65-205d-5986-a9397463a315@ganssle.io>

Happy New Year everyone!

I would like to start a thread here for wider feedback on my proposal to
change the return type of the addition operation between a datetime
subclass and a timedelta. Currently, adding a timedelta to a subclass of
datetime /always/ returns a datetime rather than an instance of the
datetime subclass.

I have an open PR implementing this, PR #10902
<https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/10902>, but I know it's a major
change so I did not want to move forward without more discussion. I
first brought this up on datetime-SIG
<https://mail.python.org/archives/list/datetime-sig at python.org/thread/TGB3VZS5EKM4R2VFUA44323FZFRN2DSJ/>
[1], and we decided to move the discussion over here because the people
most likely to object to the change would be on this list and not on
datetime-SIG.

In addition to the datetime-SIG thread, you may find a detailed
rationale for the change in bpo-35364
<https://bugs.python.org/issue35364#msg331065> [2],? and a rationale for
why we would want to (and arguably already /do/) support subclassing
datetime in bpo-32417 <https://bugs.python.org/issue32417#msg331353> [3].

A short version of the strongest rationale for changing how this works
is that it is causing inconsistencies in how subclassing is handled in
alternate constructors of datetime. For a given subclass of datetime
(which I will call DateTimeSub), nearly all alternate constructors
already support subclasses correctly - DateTimeSub.fromtimestamp(x) will
return a DateTimeSub, for example. However, because DateTimeSub +
timedelta returns datetime, any alternate constructor implemented in
terms of timedelta additions will leak that implementation detail by
returning a datetime object instead of the subclass. The biggest problem
is that datetime.fromutc is defined in terms of timedelta addition, so
DateTimeSub.now() returns a DateTimeSub object, but
DateTimeSub.now(timezone.utc) returns a datetime object! This is one of
the most annoying things to work around when building a datetime
subclass, and I don't know of any situation where someone /wants/ their
subclass to be lost on addition with a timedelta.

From my understanding, this has been discussed before and the original
objection was that this implementation assumes that the datetime
subclass has a constructor with the same (or a sufficiently similar)
signature as datetime. This may be a legitimate gripe, but unfortunately
that ship has sailed long ago. All of datetime's alternate constructors
make this assumption. Any subclass that does not meet this requirement
must have worked around it long ago (or they don't care about alternate
constructors).

Thanks for your attention, I look forward to your replies.

Best,

Paul

David may of course provide an answer for himself, but allow me to
provide my answer (and this is why I pushed for allowing external
nominations).

Historically, the only reason to become a core committer was to commit
code. Some of us no doubt desired or demonstrated greater influence, but
all of us have committed code or reviewed and merged PRs, either
directly to CPython or one of the related projects.

This is not a job for everyone, but it's been the only job we had on offer.

The closest alternative job was to be elected to the board of the Python
Software Foundation. But this is still not a job for everyone. They also
are not considered core committers, despite making significant
contributions.

We now have a new job on offer. Exactly what that job involves isn't
quite defined yet, but it will certainly include some amount of
project/program/process management, likely some customer/user engagement
(or relationship management, if you prefer), and potentially some
independent decision making.

Guido is the only core developer who has previously contributed to
Python in this way (whatever "this way" turns out to mean). The rest of
us happily worked under "someone else" doing it.

Meanwhile, many non-core committers in the Python community have spent
their time building companies, consulting businesses or educational
courses. Spending time writing code and reviewing PRs is not how they
want to contribute, and so they have contributed in other ways -
including writing and often reviewing PEPs. There was no need for them
to be a core committer, since they weren't doing any of the
committer-specific tasks.

In the PEP 8016 discussions (pre vote), we agreed that if we chose to
elect someone who is not currently a core developer, we would also
probably vote to make them a core developer, so there is no harm in
allowing externals to be nominated. Also since the core committers are
voluntarily submitting to their guidance, it makes sense that voting to
elect/dissolve is restricted to us.

In summary, members of the Steering Council are filling a new role with
only one explicit precedent within the core committers. The
qualifications are different, and so the pool of candidates is
different. The existing core committers will submit to the Steering
Council, and so are the ones who elect them.

(Note that I've carefully used "core committer" and "core developer"
above. I believe it's very important to distinguish between "write
access on GitHub" and "project decision maker", and no reason to force
an arbitrary overlap.)

Cheers,
Steve

Not exactly.  Nick's role on packaging comes to mind.  More modestly,
several of us have served as BDFL delegates, have steered various
processes (such as VCS migration), and/or have been responsible
(officially or not) for subparts of the project (such as documentation,
buildbots, version control...).

The Council is going to be a 5-person body, some some amount of
involvement and dedication is expected from each of the Council's
members if we want it to function correctly (it's probably not just a
supervision body where you can participate in a meeting every 3 months,
answer a couple e-mails and call it done).

I already have a hard time imagining my level of involvement being
enough for candidating on the Council.  So I would be skeptical of
voting for someone who hasn't submitted a single patch to the codebase
in 10+ years, for example.

Moreover, someone who has never contributed to the codebase hasn't
really experienced how contributing works, which doesn't make them a
very good candidate for managing contributors, IMHO.

Regards

Antoine.

I do not wish to presume too much on the judgement of the core developers.
But I thank Steve Dower for his characterizations which pretty much exactly
explain why I've had those involvements with the Python community and
language I have had, and haven't done other things.

I've been part of the Python community since 1998, but really active in it
since about 2001.  During the early 2000s, I wrote a large number of widely
read articles promoting Python, often delving into explaining semi-obscure
features and language design issues.  Most of these were with in my column
_Charming Python_.  I believe that several changes in Python itself?such as
making coroutines easier to use and the design of metaclasses and class
decorators?were significantly influenced by things I wrote on the topics.

Mostly in the period after writing that column, i.e. during the 2010s, I
served as a Director of the PSF; both before and since my time as a
Director, I've chaired several PSF committees.  That likewise felt like a
way I could advance Python best, but from more of an organizational or
social perspective than a technical one.  It is interesting to me that
whereas when I started volunteering for the PSF, there was significant
overlap between the PSF board and the core-committers, I think there is
little or no overlap today.  For better or worse, PSF is much more
community than technical today.  I feel like my own skills and interest
remain somewhat at the intersection of those aspects of Python.

I did not choose during that time, nor since, to become a CPython core
developer.  I've certainly contributed to other projects in the Python
ecosystem (I'm not sure if those are "related projects" in the sense Steve
mentions).  Part of that is time commitment needed, but more of it is my
personal strategic choices about what I could best do to advance Python in
the world.  I've felt I can do more by writing, speaking, and participating
in the PSF, than I would have by working on the CPython code base itself.

In particular, I always felt that I am not nearly as strong of a *C*
developer as are most core developers.  In Python itself, yes, but not in
C.  I am certain that I could have found some small bug to fix or small
feature to add, and gotten it accepted.  But doing that would have taken me
comparatively more effort than it would many others; I felt that effort was
better targeted towards educating Python users and teaching the user-level
language design choices Python has made.

If the core developers feel that the overwhelming qualification for the
Steering Committee is familiarity with the C code base of CPython, then
indeed I am not the best candidate for that.  If language design issues are
more important?and especially if thinking about Python's place among users
and industry are important, then I think I'm a very good candidate for the
role.  In particular, I believe my judgement about "Is this feature good
for Python users?" would be as good as that of most anyone (maybe other
than Guido); but I recognize that my judgement about "Is this feature
straightforward to implement in CPython?" or "What are the performance
implications of this features?" are weaker than those of most core
developers.  Not to say I have *no* instinct about those other questions,
but I know to defer.

Best, David...

Those are useful things to know, thank you.

Obviously not the overwhelming qualification (though at least _some_ of
the committee members would have to be familiar with the C code base, I
think).

That, but I think also familiarity with the development and
contribution process, will definitely play a role.  In other words, if
some external candidate gets elected I would hope they take the time to
become familiar with how things work in that regard, and try to
contribute themselves (not necessarily to make important contributions
to the codebase but to understand the daily routine).

While this was used as a possible rationale for the way standard types
behave, the main objection to changing datetime classes is that it will
make them behave differently from builtins.  For example:

>>> class F(float):
...     pass
...
>>> type(F.fromhex('AA'))
<class '__main__.F'>
>>> type(F(1) + F(2))
<class 'float'>

This is right, but the same argument is equally applicable to int, float,
etc. subclasses.  If you want to limit your change to datetime types you
should explain what makes these types special.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Compilation of "except FooExc as var" adds useless
 store
Message-ID: <20190106131048.6e0a3dd8@x230>

Hello,

As explained in
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-try-statement ,

except E as N:
    foo

is actually compiled as:

except E as N:
    try:
        foo
    finally:
        del N

But looking at the generated bytecode, it's worse than that:

             16 STORE_NAME               1 (N)
             18 POP_TOP
             20 SETUP_FINALLY            8 (to 30)

  4          22 LOAD_NAME                2 (foo)
             24 POP_TOP
             26 POP_BLOCK
             28 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
        >>   30 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
             32 STORE_NAME               1 (N)
             34 DELETE_NAME              1 (N)
             36 END_FINALLY


It's clear that what happens there is that first None is stored to N,
just to del it as the next step. Indeed, that's what done in the
compile.c:

https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/compile.c#L2905

Storing None looks superfluous. For example, DELETE_FAST explicitly
stores NULL on delete.
https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/ceval.c#L2249 

Likewise, for DELETE_NAME/DELETE_GLOBAL, PyObject_DelItem() is
called which translates to:

m->mp_ass_subscript(o, key, (PyObject*)NULL);

So hopefully any compliant mapping implementation actually clears
stored value, not leaving it dangling.

The "store None" behavior can be traced down to introduction of the
"del except target var" behavior back in 2007:
https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/b940e113bf90ff71b0ef57414ea2beea9d2a4bc0#diff-cb296cc5109f5640ff3f6d7198a6abeeR1999

There's no clear explanation why it's done like that, so probably an
artifact of the initial implementation. Note that even
https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/520b7ae27e39d1c77ea74ccd1b184d7cb43f9dcb
which did quite a bunch of refactoring to "except" implementation, and
reformatted this code, otherwise left it in place.

P.S.
I actually wanted to argue that such an implementation is hardly ideal
at all. Consider:

----
e = "my precious data"

try:
    1/0
except Exception as e:
    pass

# Where's my *global* variable?
# Worse, my variable can be gone or not, depending on whether exception
# triggered or not.
print(e)
----

So, perhaps the change should be not removing "e = None" part, but
conversely, removing the "del e" part.

With something as clearly deliberate as this, it's generally safe to
assume there's a good reason for it. But I would very much like to see
that reason documented, preferably with an example of something that
could otherwise fail.

No, there's a good reason for having the "del e", and that's to
prevent reference loops (since the exception includes the full
traceback, including all local variables). However, I would argue -
and HAVE argued - that this would be a perfect situation for an inner
scope, where the inner variable "e" is actually shadowing, rather than
overwriting, your outer "e". But the push-back against *that* proposal
was insane.

Absolutely, and one doesn't need to look far for an example. For 20
years Python was devoid of ":=", then, suddenly... ;-).

Yeah, I'm keen to know too!

So, I'm not sure if I made that clear, but the issue is that currently
the generated code tries to break the reference loop *twice*. But once
should be enough. And which one of "N = None" or "del N" is better is
something to consider.

That's not "worse", that's BETTER.

With e deleted, you get an immediate exception the moment you try to use 
it, and you *know* something has gone wrong, instead of the program 
continuing, either to fail much later, where it isn't clear why the code 
fails, or worse, not fail at all, but instead silently do the wrong 
thing.

Incorrect code that fails sooner is better than incorrect code that 
fails later, and MUCH better than incorrect code that doesn't fail at 
all.

The real problem here is that if e holds your precious data, why are you 
assigning an exception to e? You probably wouldn't complain that this 
breaks your program:

e = "my precious data"
import sys as e
# where is my data???

or this:

e = "my precious data"
e = None

so why do you expect `except Exception as e` to be different? Its just a 
name binding operation, the same as all the others.

Regardless of the mechanism, if you don't want to lose your precious 
data, then don't use the same name. But if you truly, really must 
overwrite e, then there is a simple work-around:

e = "my precious data"
try:
    1/0
except Exception as err:
    e = err


Having the exception name unbound at the end of the block is a weird and 
unfortunate wart on the language, but not as unfortunate as having 
exceptions cause long-lasting reference cycles.

Ack. Such an explanation makes sense, though semantics behind it is
"magic". And given that variable deletion happens conditionally on
whether exception happened or not, it's still pretty strange. I would
definitely find a behavior of merely clearing an "except" target
variable to be more understandable than magic fiddling with namespaces.

[]

Because I got an idea that "except Exc as var" introduces a nested
lexical scope for "var"? I.e., a completely new variable is introduced,
which may shadow, but not override, any on the enclosing scope.

Why would I get that idea? Well, because lexical scoping is a
well-known concept in many programming languages, Python included. For
example, list/set/etc. comprehensions have proper lexical scope, how
would I imagine that specifically in except clauses, it's not a proper
lexical scoping, but a leaky "emulation" of it? 

That said, the description in
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-try-statement
doesn't give any false promises regarding lexical scoping. Instead, it
effectively says that the behavior is CPython implementation detail:

"Exceptions are cleared because with the traceback attached to them,
they form a reference cycle"


So, the only thing to take away from this might be indeed an opportunity
to save 4 bytes of bytecode/2 dispatches.

Thanks, that summarizes it well. And well, my interest is also how
non-compliant would be for another Python implementation to act
differently, specifically to skip wrapping an except handler body in
try-finally (i.e., go back to Python2 behavior). I'm keen to add such
an option to my fork of MicroPython.

I don't think anyone *likes* the current behaviour. Speaking for myself, 
I think it is definitely a wart on the language, but a justifiable one, 
since the alternative is worse.

So yes, it is strange, and is something that Python programmers have to 
learn. Probably through experience.

I don't understand what this means. What is "clearing an except target"? 
Do you mean deleting the target name? Names are either bound to an 
object, or they aren't bound at all, so I don't know what it means to 
"clear" a name if it doesn't mean delete it.

It isn't an emulation of lexical scope at all. Only the exception target 
is deleted, not other variables bound inside the block.

But a better question is, why would you (generic, not you personally) 
imagine that, alone out of all flow control statements, ONLY "except" 
clauses introduce a new scope? Every other flow control statement (for, 
while, if, elif, else, try, with) runs in the current scope. The only 
statements which create a new scope are def and class. (Did I miss any?)

Wouldn't that mean that MicroPython suffers from the exception/traceback 
reference cycle problem? How do you propose to solve that?

Setting it to None before unbinding it. It's apparently not enough to
say "del e" - you have to do "e = None; del e". Check the OP.

Because there is a reason for such code.

See issue1631942 [1] and the thread with the subject "self-contained 
exceptions" on the Python-3000 mailing list [2] for the rationale.

In short, the code

     try:
         1/0
     except Exception as e:
         del e

should work.

I do not see a problem with storing None before deleting a variable. 
This is not a performance critical code, because it is executed only 
when an exception was raised and caught.

To be fair except is already unique in that it /does/ "pseudo-scope" the
binding to the variable. The other obvious comparisons are to for loops
and context managers, both of which bind a value to a name that survives
after the exit of the control flow statement.

Given the reference counting reasons for exceptions *not* to outlive
their control flow statement, they are the "odd man out" in that they
delete the exception after the control statement's body exits. To me,
the natural and intuitive way to do this would be to have the exception
live in its own scope where it shadows existing variables, rather than
replacing and then completely removing them. The way it works now is
halfway between the behavior of existing control flow statements and
having a proper nested scope.

Not saying that anything has to change - in the end this is one of the
more minor "gotchas" about Python, and there may be practical reasons
for leaving it as it is - but I do think it's worth noting that for many
people this /will/ be surprising behavior, even if you know that
exceptions don't survive outside of the "except" block.

But obviously not, because the code was specifically written to set it
to None first. It's not the sort of thing that can be done
accidentally, is it?

Subject: [Python-Dev] Return type of datetime subclasses added to

Message-ID: <bb5120e0-159e-106d-04c6-2a15f7398966@ganssle.io>

I can think of many reasons why datetime is different from builtins,
though to be honest I'm not sure that consistency for its own sake is
really a strong argument for keeping a counter-intuitive behavior - and
to be honest I'm open to the idea that /all/ arithmetic types /should/
have some form of this change.

That said, I would say that the biggest difference between datetime and
builtins (other than the fact that datetime is /not/ a builtin, and as
such doesn't necessarily need to be categorized in this group), is that
unlike almost all other arithmetic types, /datetime/ has a special,
dedicated type for describing differences in datetimes. Using your
example of a float subclass, consider that without the behavior of
"addition of floats returns floats", it would be hard to predict what
would happen in this situation:

>>> F(1.2) + 3.4

Would that always return a float, even though F(1.2) + F(3.4) returns an
F? Would that return an F because F is the left-hand operand? Would it
return a float because float is the right-hand operand? Would you walk
the MROs and find the lowest type in common between the operands and
return that? It's not entirely clear which subtype predominates. With
datetime, you have:

datetime - datetime -> timedelta
datetime ? timedelta -> datetime
timedelta ? timedelta -> timedelta

There's no operation between two datetime objects that would return a
datetime object, so it's always clear: operations between datetime
subclasses return timedelta, operations between a datetime object and a
timedelta return the subclass of the datetime that it was added to or
subtracted from.

Of course, the real way to resolve whether datetime should be different
from int/float/string/etc is to look at why this choice was actually
made for those types in the first place, and decide whether datetime is
like them /in this respect/. The heterogeneous operations problem may be
a reasonable justification for leaving the other builtins alone but
changing datetime, but if someone knows of other fundamental reasons why
the decision to have arithmetic operations always create the base class
was chosen, please let me know.

Best,
Paul

Which I read, and they do not explain the assignment of None. The only
reference is that the tracker issue mentions having a test case to
ensure that it's happening, which is further proof that it's
intentional, but still fails to explain *why*.

I think Serhiy is saying that if you delete exc before the except body ends, when the compiled code goes to delete it it will fail. Binding to None guarantees that there is something to delete.

Ahh! Thank you. I interpreted that example as a "this is what it
compiles to", rather than actual source code that might fail. Can we
get this example, suitably annotated, into the documentation
somewhere?

I am not familiar enough with the compiler logic, but would it be possible to optimize this away by detecting whether the bound name has already been deleted during the body of the except statement?

I don't see a reason to document this behavior -- it would be strange if it
*didn't* work.

If we had an opcode to delete a variable but didn't raise if it is unset,
we could use that, but otherwise I see no action needed here.

Let's assume we have

class DT(datetime.datetime): ...
class TD(datetime.timedelta): ...

What is the result type for the following expressions?
DT - datetime
DT - DT
DT + TD
DT + timedelta

I have a feeling that the question has no generic answer.
For *particular* implementation you can override all __add__, __sub__
and other arithmetic operations, and you can do it right now with the
current datetime module implementation.

P.S.
I think inheritance from datetime classes is a very rare thing, 99.99% of
users don't need it.

I don't think datetime and builtins like int necessarily need to be
aligned. But I do see a problem -- the __new__ and __init__ methods defined
in the subclass (if any) should allow for being called with the same
signature as the base datetime class. Currently you can have a subclass of
datetime whose __new__ has no arguments (or, more realistically, interprets
its arguments differently). Instances of such a class can still be added to
a timedelta. The proposal would cause this to break (since such an addition
has to create a new instance, which calls __new__ and __init__). Since this
is a backwards incompatibility, I don't see how it can be done -- and I
also don't see many use cases, so I think it's not worth pursuing further.

Note that the same problem already happens with the .fromordinal() class
method, though it doesn't happen with .fromdatetime() or .now():

>>> class D(datetime.datetime):
...   def __new__(cls): return cls.now()
...
>>> D()
D(2019, 1, 6, 10, 33, 37, 161606)
>>> D.fromordinal(100)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: __new__() takes 1 positional argument but 4 were given
>>> D.fromtimestamp(123456789)

It is not really complicated, the default "difference between two
datetimes" returns a `timedelta`, you can change that by overriding
`__sub__` or `__rsub__` as desired, but there's no reason to think that
the fact that just because DT is a subclass of datetime that it would be
coupled to a specific timedelta subclass *by default*.

Similarly, DT + TD by default will do whatever "datetime" and
"timedelta" do unless you specifically override them. In my proposal,
adding some time to a datetime subclass would return an object of the
datetime subclass, so unless __radd__ or __rsub__ were overriden in
`timedelta`, that's what would happen, the defaults would be (sensibly):

DT - datetime -> timedelta
DT - DT -> timedelta
DT + TD -> DT
DT + timedelta -> timedelta

The only time it would be more complicated is if datetime were defined
like this:

class datetime:
??? TIMEDELTA_CLASS = datetime.timedelta
??? ...

In which case you'd have the same problem you have with float/int/etc
(not a particularly more complicated one. But that's not the case, and
there /is/ one obviously right answer. This is not the case with float
subclasses, because the intuitive rule is "adding together two objects
of the same class gives the same class", which fails when you have two
different subclasses. With datetime, you have "adding a delta type to a
value type returns an object of the value type", which makes perfect
sense, as opposed to "adding a delta type to a value type returns the
base value type, even if the base value type was never used".

Both of these points are addressed in my original post, IIRC, but both
of these arguments cut both ways. Assuming it's true that this is very
rare - the 0.01% of people who /are/ subclassing datetime either don't
care about this behavior or want timedelta arithmetic to return their
subclass. It's rare enough that there should be no problem giving them
what they want.

Similarly, the rarest group - people who are creating datetime
subclasses /and/ want the original behavior - can simply implement
__add__ and __sub__ to get what they want, so there's no real conflict,
it's just a matter of setting a sane default that also solves the
problem that datetime alternate constructors tend to leak their
implementation details because of the arithmetic return type issue.


Best, Paul

This is explained on a discussion on the Python-3000 mailing list. I 
provided a code example which would fail if do not perform such 
assignment. The test, mentioned in the tracker issue, contains similar code.

(Dark) Magic. Live and learn/think. So, we allow user to delete a var,
then recreate it, just to delete again. Thanks for both the hint and
references, Serhiy!

I can only agree with what Chris wrote in the initial reply - it
would nice if there would be an explanation of these tricks somewhere.
I myself wouldn't know a better place than the source code comments.
Well, at least I did trace it to the source code where it's handled.

From CPython's points of view, I might (well, have to) agree. But I was
pretty surprised/disappointed that MicroPython follows the same
routine, I'm glad I now understand ins and outs of the choices made.

I did address this in the original post - the assumption that the
subclass constructor will have the same arguments as the base
constructor is baked into many alternate constructors of datetime. I
acknowledge that this is a breaking change, but it is a small one -
anyone creating such a subclass that /cannot/ handled the class being
created this way would be broken in myriad ways.

We have also in recent years changed several alternate constructors
(including `replace`) to retain the original subclass, which by your
same standard would be a breaking change. I believe there have been no
complaints. In fact, between Python 3.6 and 3.7, the very example you
showed broke:

Python 3.6.6:

>>> class D(datetime.datetime):
...???? def __new__(cls):
...???????? return cls.now()
...
>>> D()
D(2019, 1, 6, 13, 49, 38, 842033)

Python 3.7.2:

>>> class D(datetime.datetime):
...???? def __new__(cls):
...???????? return cls.now()
...
>>> D()
Traceback (most recent call last):
? File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
? File "<stdin>", line 3, in __new__
TypeError: __new__() takes 1 positional argument but 9 were given


We haven't seen any bug reports about this sort of thing; what we /have/
been getting is bug reports that subclassing datetime doesn't retain the
subclass in various ways (because people /are/ using datetime
subclasses). This is likely to cause very little in the way of problems,
but it will improve convenience for people making datetime subclasses
and almost certainly performance for people using them (e.g. pendulum
and arrow, which now need to take a slow pure python route in many
situations to work around this problem).

If we're /really/ concerned with this backward compatibility breaking,
we could do the equivalent of:

try:
??? return new_behavior(...)
except TypeError:
??? warnings.warn("The semantics of timedelta addition have "
????????????????? "changed in a way that raises an error in "
????????????????? "this subclass. Please implement __add__ "

To answer this, MicroPython doesn't have reference counting and relies
solely on garbage collection, so breaking cycles early wouldn't have
much effect. Breaking stray links to should-be-dead data structures
might (to allow them to be collected sooner rather than later), but
probably not at the expense of introducing extra entry in the block
stack. (That may seems like breadcrumb saving, but saving a few
percents of overhead in many places is how MicroPython achieves
its promise of programming small embedded systems in a very high level
language.)

Maybe someone can propose a code comment to explain this instead? I agree
that this doesn't need to be explained in the language spec, but I don't
see any harm in a comment where the opcodes are emitted to explain why it
is the way it is .

To help set expectations, the current semantics are not a bug and so the
proposal isn't fixing a bug but proposing a change in semantics.

We very much do care. Because this isn't a bug but a voluntary semantic
change you're proposing to change we can't blindly break people who are
relying on the current semantics. We need to have a justification for those
people as to why we have decided to change the semantics now after all of
these years as well as provide an upgrade path.

Brett,

Thank you for bringing this up, but I think you /may/ have misunderstood
my position - though maybe you understood the thrust and wanted to
clarify for people coming in halfway, which I applaud.

I proposed this change /knowing/ that it was a breaking change - it's
why I brought it to the attention of datetime-SIG and now python-dev -
and I believe that there are several factors that lead this to being a
smaller compatibility problem than it seems.

One such factor is the fact that /many/ other features of `datetime`,
including the implementation of `datetime.now()` are /already broken/ in
the current implementation for anyone who would be broken by this
particular aspect of the semantic change. That is not saying that it's
impossible that there is code out there that will break if this change
goes through, it's just saying that the scope of the breakage is
necessarily very limited.

The reason I brought up the bug tracker is because between Python 3.6
and Python 3.7, we in fact made a similar breaking change to the one I'm
proposing here without thinking that anyone might be relying on the fact
that they could do something like:

class D(datetime.datetime):
??? def __new__(cls):
??????? return cls.now()

My point was that there have been no bug reports about the /existing
change/ that Guido was bringing up (his example itself does not work on
Python 3.7!), which leads me to believe that few if any people are
relying on the fact that it is possible to define a datetime subclass
with a different default constructor.

As I mentioned, it is likely possible to have a transition period where
this would still work even if the subclassers have not created their own
__add__ method.

There is no way to create a similar deprecation/transition period for
people relying on the fact that `type(datetime_obj + timedelta_obj) ==
datetime.datetime`, but I think this is honestly a sufficiently minor
breakage that the good outweighs the harm. I will note that we have
already made several such changes with respect to alternate constructors
even though technically someone could have been relying on the fact that
`MyDateTime(*args).replace(month=3)` returns a `datetime` object.

This is not to say that we should lightly make the change (hence my
canvassing for opinions), it is just that there is a good amount of
evidence that, practically speaking, no one is relying on this, and in
fact it is likely that people are writing code that assumes that adding
`timedelta` to a datetime subclass returns the original subclass, either
directly or indirectly - I think we're likely to fix more people than we
break if we make this change.

Best,
Paul

OK, I concede your point (and indeed I only tested this on 3.6). If we
could break the backward compatibility for now() we presumably can break it
for this purpose.

Subject: [Python-Dev] python subprocess module to submit a list of slurm
 sbatch jobs,
 each job use multiprocessing.Pool to run simulation on single compute node
 in cluster
Message-ID: <ede904dacb9e40a880f8a8c52c58e463@eng.ua.edu>

Dear Developers,
I have been working on a piece of code development that need your sincere help (three code file attached here).

I use run_slurm.py to use python subprocess module to submit multiple jobs to slurm cluster by invoking a sbatch file with a for loop to reach the following target:

1) create some environmental variables for job_slurm.py to run simulations (values of these environmental variables will change for each job with the for loop)

2) invoke submit_slurm.sh to submit a sbatch job that will run job_slurm.py

3) each job_slurm.py will use python multiprocess.Pool to run parallized simulations on each ./mod_bart.sh exeutable file (will run for a few hours) on a single compute node in cluster using all cores of this compute node

I get the following error all the time, could you provide some insights on how our implementation is wrong to achieve the desired goal:


Exception in thread Thread-3:
Traceback (most recent call last):

Message-ID: <6C486AB80682E24095E3E77A408D68F201499C9AF5@ALA-MBD.corp.ad.wrs.com>

Hi Python Developers,
I'm Brian Kuhl, I've spent about  28 years working with embedded software. Since 2000 I've worked for Wind River. I'm currently a manager of documentation and customer training in our Ottawa, Canada office. Throughout my career I've had an interest in the use of open source software in embedded systems, have ported many libraries to Wind River's flagship product the VxWorks RTOS.

The safe and secure embedded market where VxWorks is the leader is evolving, and devices that use to be made up of multiple processors running multiple operating systems are now being consolidated. Device security and IoT trends mean a device must be more configurable and updateable, and a better host for portable code. In this evolving space our  customers have asked us to add Python support to VxWorks.

Wind River would like cpython to officially support VxWorks.  I've been ask by my colleagues to volunteer as a maintainer for cpython in order to support this effort.  Wind River will also provide the needed buildbot clients required to verify continuing VxWorks support.

Myself and an intern were able to get the majority of Python tests suite passing with a POC last year.
An engineering group in Beijing  have taken that POC and are improving and cleaning up that effort now with the hopes of up-steaming their efforts.

My Chinese colleagues have suggested that the first step to gaining your support would be to summit a PEP detailing the changes?
If you agree, I will proceed with authoring a PEP.

Many thanks in advance for your responses,

Brian


P.S. I can be found on  github (and many other places) as kuhlenough.

Hi Brian,

I am glad that this is happening!

I don't think you need a PEP to motivate your request -- however you need
to submit the upstream patches, work with the CPython buildbot managers
(Victor?) to connect your buildbots, and work with reviewers (Serhiy?) to
get your patches integrated in CPython. Hopefully the patches are small and
focused -- we generally don't take patches that refactor large swaths of
code. It's also better not to submit everything in a single giant patch
(reviewers hate mega-patches). And the patch submitters need to be
responsive when the code review comments are coming.

This is not a one-time effort -- your team will need to be "on call" to
handle VxWorks issues for the foreseeable future (a minimum commitment of 5
years?), and your team members needs to be able to do this in their
capacity as Wind River engineers, not as open source volunteers.

I believe there is a PEP with a list of supported operating systems that
needs to be updated, but I don't recall which one it is -- hopefully you
can track it down with a little Googling. (Or was it the devguide?)

Good luck,

--Guido

Subject: [Python-Dev] AMD64 Windows8.1 Refleaks 3.x buildbot is back to
 green!
Message-ID: <CA+3bQGG3kqX3z_GCeEQNAOa=WVh1Nc9iopZyT305cFztZCAM1w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The "AMD64 Windows 8.1 Refleaks 3.x" buildbot (which hunts reference
leaks and memory leaks) was failing on test_asyncio for 1 year:

   https://bugs.python.org/issue32710

It was a leak of a single reference:

   test_aiosend leaked [1, 1, 1] references, sum=3

I tried multiple times since last year (January 2018) to understand
the leak: it didn't make any sense (well, as any bug at the beginning,
no?). I checked several times the complex asyncio code: all transports
are cleanly closed, the event loop is properly closed, etc. The code
looks correct.

After a long sleepness night... I still failed to reproduce the bug
:-( But I succeeded to get a way shorter reproducer script. Thanks to
this script, I was able to loop to get 100 reference leaks instead of
leaking a single reference. Using tracemalloc, I found the faulty
line... but it still didn't make sense to me. After additional several
hours of debug, I found that an overlapped object wasn't released
properly: an asynchronous WSASend().

The problem was when an overlapped WSASend() failed immediately, the
internal buffer was not released, whereas it holds a reference to the
input byte string. **It means that an asyncio send() failure using the
ProactorEventLoop can cause a memory leak**... I'm very surprised that
nobody noticed such **huge** memory leak previously!

The _overlapped bugfix:

https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/a234e148394c2c7419372ab65b773d53a57f3625

Eventually, the "AMD64 Windows 8.1 Refleaks 3.x" buildbot is back to green!

   https://buildbot.python.org/all/#/builders/80

It means that it will be easier and faster to spot reference or memory
leak regressions (specific to Windows, the Gentoo Refleaks buildbot
was already green for several months!).

Since ProactorEventLoop became the default event loop in Python 3.8
(on Windows, it's specific to Windows), I hope that we fixed all most
obvious bugs!

This story also means that any very tiny buildbot failure (a single
test method failure on a single very specific buildbot) can hide a
giant bug ;-) Sadly, we have to fix *all* buildbots failures to find
them... Hopefully, almost all buildbots are green currently.

Hi,

It's a PEP. The process and expectations for platform are explained in
PEP 11, https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0011/

If possible it would also be helpful to get SSH access to some VxWorks
machines for core devs. I know that Victor likes to dig into rare corner
cases and help to debug exotic platforms.

That's great!

I would add that many Windows Proactor bugs were found after implementing
sendfile support.
If sendfile is not available for some reason asyncio uses a fallback to
send a file content chunk-by-chunk reading it in memory.
The fallback code was easy and straightforward, it worked just fine on
Linux but the same code failed on proactor.

Thank you very much, Victor, for finally pinning the problem down.

Subject: Re: [Python-Dev] VxWorks and cpython?

Hi Brian,

I am glad that this is happening!

I don't think you need a PEP to motivate your request -- however you need to submit the upstream patches, work with the CPython buildbot managers (Victor?) to connect your buildbots, and work with reviewers (Serhiy?) to get your patches integrated in CPython. Hopefully the patches are small and focused -- we generally don't take patches that refactor large swaths of code. It's also better not to submit everything in a single giant patch (reviewers hate mega-patches). And the patch submitters need to be responsive when the code review comments are coming.

This is not a one-time effort -- your team will need to be "on call" to handle VxWorks issues for the foreseeable future (a minimum commitment of 5 years?), and your team members needs to be able to do this in their capacity as Wind River engineers, not as open source volunteers.

I believe there is a PEP with a list of supported operating systems that needs to be updated, but I don't recall which one it is -- hopefully you can track it down with a little Googling. (Or was it the devguide?)

Good luck,

--Guido

Hi Python Developers,
I?m Brian Kuhl, I?ve spent about  28 years working with embedded software. Since 2000 I?ve worked for Wind River. I?m currently a manager of documentation and customer training in our Ottawa, Canada office. Throughout my career I?ve had an interest in the use of open source software in embedded systems, have ported many libraries to Wind River?s flagship product the VxWorks RTOS.

The safe and secure embedded market where VxWorks is the leader is evolving, and devices that use to be made up of multiple processors running multiple operating systems are now being consolidated. Device security and IoT trends mean a device must be more configurable and updateable, and a better host for portable code. In this evolving space our  customers have asked us to add Python support to VxWorks.

Wind River would like cpython to officially support VxWorks.  I?ve been ask by my colleagues to volunteer as a maintainer for cpython in order to support this effort.  Wind River will also provide the needed buildbot clients required to verify continuing VxWorks support.

Myself and an intern were able to get the majority of Python tests suite passing with a POC last year.
An engineering group in Beijing  have taken that POC and are improving and cleaning up that effort now with the hopes of up-steaming their efforts.

My Chinese colleagues have suggested that the first step to gaining your support would be to summit a PEP detailing the changes?
If you agree, I will proceed with authoring a PEP.

Many thanks in advance for your responses,

Brian

The best case to get a full support is to have one core developer
responsible of handling all bugs specific to the platform.

As a core developer, I'm never comfortable to merge a change specific
to a platform if I'm not able to validate it manually myself. I trust
no one, not even myself (I know well that I do frequently mistakes!),
so I prefer to always double check changes before merging them ;-)

In the meanwhile, I would say that we can only offer "best effort"
support. Fix reports bugs and do our best in our limited time.

Someone has to take the work done to port Python on VxWorks and write
small pull requests. These PRs should be reviewed one by one to make
sure that it's the correct way to fix an issue. Be prepared that it
can take several months even if all these changes look obvious to
*you*. Core developers have limited time and many prefer to focus on
the platforms that they are using, not worry about a platform they
never heard about... I can have a look at such PRs.

It would also help to have a documentation somewhere about "Python on
VxWorks". Pointers to VxWorks (general info, developers info),
pointers to your port, current status of the port, etc.

Victor

It feels like it would be a good idea for Brian or someone else from
Wind River to work towards becoming a core developer? If Brian, et al
are interested, is there a core developer who would be willing to
mentor them?

Hi Victor,
I think we can come up with some sort of strategy that will work for everyone. 
I'll ask about the SSH access; and if that runs up against a corporate roadblock, I will explore some other alternative. 

Is there a good place to document "Python on VxWorks" ?
The changes to Python are not large, I've kept the pull request from last year's POC active. The changed files provide a good summary of the scope.
https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/4184/files
However, based on the POC we've gone back and improved VxWorks, so the some of the uglier bits, in libraries like submodule, won't be needed.
These will be in the next release of VxWorks. 

However we let automake and setup.py do much of the work for us, so where VxWorks  does not have support for something, it's not obvious.
A public document would go a long way to filling in those details, something much more detailed than  my glib "VxWorks is almost POSIX" in the pull request.  

Other challenges; 
* VxWorks is cross-compiled on both Linux and Windows. ( currently with clang and gcc)
* Supported on ARM,  PowerPC and Intel processors
* 32bit and 64bit builds 
* A constantly evolving set of reference boards (or BSPs)   
https://marketplace.windriver.com/index.php?bsp&on=list&type=platform&value=VxWorks:%207%20-%20Wind%20River%20Workbench%204.0

I don't think we need a buildbot for every board.  I'm thinking a 1/2 dozen to cover ARM, PPC and IA with both a 32bit and 64 bit build?
We have a bit of chicken and egg problem right now, a buildbot will always fail until there's some basic VxWorks support added. 

Do we set them up, and just let them fail, till enough PRs are accepted to make it build?

Brian

Anywhere. If you don't know, you might use
https://wiki.python.org/moin/ ... But I'm not sure that the wiki is
still widely used. Many pages may be outdated.

That's a giant PR. Sorry, I'm unable to review that. Usually, I simply
ignore such PR.

Cross-compilation is complex. So yeah, any documentation is more than
welcome. Many people are still fighting to try to get a working Python
on Android... My notes:
https://pythondev.readthedocs.io/android.html
(is there still someone working on that?)

> Other challenges;

I don't think that it should be an issue for Python. Very few parts of
CPython are architecture specific. I'm aware of ctypes which is more
or less optional. ctypes rely on libffi which supports a wide range of
architectures.

> * 32bit and 64bit builds

We have a wide range of 32 and 64 bits buildbot workers. I don't
expect any issue here.

Which C compiler do you use?

> https://marketplace.windriver.com/index.php?bsp&on=list&type=platform&value=VxWorks:%207%20-%20Wind%20River%20Workbench%204.0

I'm not sure how it's supposed to impact Python?

> I don't think we need a buildbot for every board.  I'm thinking a 1/2 dozen to cover ARM, PPC and IA with both a 32bit and 64 bit build?
> We have a bit of chicken and egg problem right now, a buildbot will always fail until there's some basic VxWorks support added.

No please. A *single* buildbot worker in total is enough. When you
will have a very good support and a full test suite coverage, we can
discuss about adding more flavors.

> Do we set them up, and just let them fail, till enough PRs are accepted to make it build?

Multiple buildbot workers are failing since many years. *I* would
prefer to see the full test suite passing (even if some tests are
skipped on your platform) before adding a buildbot, but it seems like
some people have a different opinion on that. For example, there is an
AIX buildbot and some tests are still failing (it was always red,
failing, no?).

You're right that it's a chicken-and-egg issue, except that we don't
have a very strong policy for buildbots.

Note: I cannot promise that I will review your PR. I can only promise
that I will have a look :-) VxWorks is not really a priority for me.
(I prefer to not give false promise here.)

To prepare this PR for review the following changes are required:

* Update it to the current master. Currently there are many conflicts.
* Remove unrelated changes, like: adding/removing empty lines, 
adding/removing spaces in unrelated lines.
* Remove unrelated changes in 'configure'. It depends on the used 
version of autoconf.
* Ensure that you do not use tabs, unless they are necessary (in Makefile).
* Make the code conforming PEP 7 and PEP 8. In particular, spaces should 
be added between 'if' and '(', between ')' and '{', opening '{' should 
be on the same line for statements, but on a new line if it is defines a 
function body, parenthesis around conditions of 'if' and 'while' are not 
needed in Python, long lines should be wrapped, etc, etc.

and the current PSF board has 2 of 11 members being core devs, whereas
the early days of the board look like they had a ratio that was more
often on the order of 4-6 core devs out of 7 members.

I take that as a sign of healthy community growth :)

Michael Felt has been working towards getting that AIX bot green, and
I merged several PRs over the end of year break to help make progress
towards that goal.

He hit a similar challenge to the one Brian will be facing: putting
all the changes in one PR can make it overwhelming to review (so the
PR stalls), but splitting them up into individual PRs can result in
changes that don't appear sufficiently well motivated on their own (so
those PRs also stall).

The AIX case is currently an example where some of the buildbot
"fixes" are actually test skips, as the goal is to get to a point
where "things that currently work on AIX keep working, while folks
interested in AIX can work towards getting the not-working things
indicated by skipped tests also working".

Cheers,
Nick.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Thanks - come a long way with getting tests resolved!
Message-ID: <7d5a4f47-0c56-020e-1857-184bf78bc858@felt.demon.nl>

Many thanks to all who assisted with feedback. Back at the start of
August my make tests had a nasty block like this:

29 tests failed:
??? test__xxsubinterpreters test_array test_asyncio test_cmath
??? test_compile test_complex test_ctypes test_distutils test_embed
??? test_float test_fractions test_getargs2 test_httplib
??? test_httpservers test_imaplib test_importlib test_math test_poplib
??? test_shutil test_signal test_socket test_ssl test_statistics
??? test_strtod test_struct test_subprocess test_time test_timeout
??? test_utf8_mode

And now that is down to:


4 tests failed:
test_eintr test_importlib test_multiprocessing_forkserver
test_multiprocessing_spawn
While I am still trying to figure out where the "multiprocessing" errors
come from - there is
only one "test" left from the original list - and that one, plus
test_eintr have PR's waiting for your approval.
I could not have gotten this far without help!
Sincerely,
Michael aka aixtools

Hello,

For the record, the pickle5 backport (PEP 574) was updated to include
the latest pickle changes from CPython git master.

pickle5 is available for Python 3.6 and 3.7.
https://pypi.org/project/pickle5/

Regards

Antoine.

I see that the PEP is still a draft. What's the status?

Do you need someone to review your PEP? Do you have anyone in mind who
can review it? I don't feel able to review such PEP, sorry :-(

Thanks! Apache Arrow may also be worth a look:

> Apache Arrow is a cross-language development platform for in-memory data.
It specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory format for
flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on
modern hardware. It also provides computational libraries and zero-copy
streaming messaging and interprocess communication.

> The Arrow Python bindings have first-class integration with NumPy,
pandas, and built-in Python objects

https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/

Pickle supports arbitrary Python objects without any schema definition
(other than that what's defined in the object's __reduce__()
and __reduce_ex__())

Maybe a bit OT: is there a way to *not pickle any callables*?

From PEP 574, "implementation section":

? Support for pickle protocol 5 and out-of-band buffers was added to the
Apache Arrow Python bindings [10]. ?

So Arrow is very much in the scope for PEP 574.

PEP 574 is ready for pronouncement.  It's waiting for an authority to
approve it (or decide on a PEP delegate, who IMHO should probably
be Nick Coghlan).

Message-ID: <20190117102605.GG13616@ando.pearwood.info>

Disclaimer: I'm not a ctypes expert, so I might have this completely 
wrong. If so, I apologise for the noise.

The id() function is documented as returning an abstract ID number. In 
CPython, that happens to have been implemented as the address of the 
object.

I understand that the only way to pass the address of an object to 
ctypes is to use that id. Is that intentional?

As I see it, there is a conflict between two facts:

- that id() returns a memory address is an implementation detail; as 
such users should not rely on it, as the implementation could (in 
principle) change without notice;

- but users using ctypes have no choice but to rely on id() returning 
the object memory address, as of it were an offical part of the API.

Implementations like PyPy which emulate ctypes, while objects don't have 
fixed memory locations, will surely have a problem here. I don't know 
how PyPy solves this.

Have I misunderstood something here?

Can you explain in detail what you're doing?
If you're calling a C API taking a PyObject*, it seems like you should
be using ctypes.py_object as argument type specifier.  Various examples
can be found with Google.

Aye, and I had already taken on that role unofficially - IIRC, the
only major change I requested was the one to allow buffer handling
callbacks to ask the pickler to include the buffer in-line after all
[1].

It was just that the BDFL-Delegate appointment process was put on hold
after Guido stepped down.

Cheers,
Nick.

It's kind of dangerous to pass an object to C without an increment of
its reference count. The proper way is to use a simple pointer of type
"O" (object), which is already created for you as the "py_object"
type.

    >>> ctypes.py_object._type_
    'O'
    >>> ctypes.py_object.__bases__
    (<class '_ctypes._SimpleCData'>,)

It keeps a reference in the readonly _objects attribute. For example:

    >>> b = bytearray(b'spam')
    >>> sys.getrefcount(b)
    2
    >>> cb = ctypes.py_object(b)
    >>> sys.getrefcount(b)
    3
    >>> cb._objects
    bytearray(b'spam')
    >>> del cb
    >>> sys.getrefcount(b)
    2

If you need the address without relying on id(), cast to a void pointer:

    >>> ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_void_p)(cb)[0] == id(b)
    True

Or instantiate a c_void_p from the py_object as a buffer:

    >>> ctypes.c_void_p.from_buffer(cb).value == id(b)
    True

Note that ctypes.cast() doesn't work in this case. It's implemented as
an FFI function that takes the object address as a void pointer. The
from_param method of c_void_p doesn't support py_object:

    >>> ctypes.c_void_p.from_param(cb)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: wrong type

I've heard that libraries using ctypes, cffi, or cython code of various
sorts in the real world wild today does abuse the unfortunate side effect
of CPython's implementation of id(). I don't have specific instances of
this in mind but trust what I've heard: that it is happening.

id() should never be considered to be the PyObject*.  In as much as code
shouldn't assume it is running on top of a specific CPython implementation.
If there is a _need_ to get a pointer to a C struct handle referencing a
CPython C API PyObject, we should make an explicit API for that rather than
the id() hack.  That way code can be explicit about its need, and code that
is just doing a funky form of identity tracking without using is and is not
can continue using id() without triggering regressive behavior on VMs that
don't have a CPython compatible PyObject under the hood by default.

I would be strongly in favour of ctypes gaining a "get address of
object" function, which happens (in current CPythons) to return the
same value as id() does, but is specifically tied to ctypes.

I use it in some of my code.

If I want to cache some objects, I put them in a dict, using the id as 
the key. If I wanted to locate an object in a cache and didn't have 
id(), I'd have to do a linear search for it.

IME it's reasonably common with ctypes, for cases where you need to do
some gross hack and there's no other option. Here's an example in
jinja2:

  https://github.com/pallets/jinja/blob/9fe9520f2daa1df6079b188adba758d6e03d6af2/jinja2/debug.py#L350

I haven't seen it with cffi or cython. (cffi explicitly doesn't
provide any way to access the CPython C API, and in cython you can
just cast an object to a pointer.)

Using id() like this is certainly offensive to our sensibilities, but
in practice I don't see how it causes much harm. If you are doing
*anything* with PyObject*, then you're tying yourself to
implementation details of CPython (and usually a specific version of
CPython). That's not great, but at that point relying on CPython's
implementation of id() is the least of your worries, and it tends to
be a self-correcting problem.

As a bonus, here's a link to the place where this answer appears in the

I feel like I should clarify - not everyone who posted got it wrong, and
I understand there's a side discussion among those who are also
interested/participants in
https://discuss.python.org/t/demoting-the-is-operator-to-avoid-an-identity-crisis/86/
- but there was no of acknowledgement of Eryk Sun's correct and useful
answer which I find very disappointing and a great way to discourage
contributions.

We can, and should, do better, at least by thanking the person for their
response before running down a barely related side track.

Eryk's answer is actually much more useful than the documentation. I've
read that documentation many times, but always decided not to use py_object
because I couldn't figure out what it would actually do...

(I still probably won't use it because IME by the time I'm using ctypes and
PyObject* together I usually need manual control over refcounts, but it's
nice to know what it actually does.)

Antoine:

Code-wise, I'm not doing anything with ctypes.

Language-wise, I'm trying to get a definitive answer of whether or not 
id() returning the address of the object should be a guaranteed feature 
or not.

Across the entire Python ecosystem, no it isn't, as Jython and 
IronPython return consecutive integers. But should we consider it an 
intentional part of the CPython API?

There are developers who insist that when it comes to CPython, id() 
returning the object address is an intentional feature that they can and 
do rely on, because (so I was told by one of them) that using id() is 
the only way to get the address of an object from pure-Python.

According to this claim, using id() to get the address for use in ctypes 
is the correct and only way to do it, and this is a deliberate design 
choice by the core devs rather than an accident of the implementation. 
So long as you know you are using CPython, this is (so I was told) 
completely safe.

In the grand scheme of things this may be a pretty minor issue. But I 
suspect that it could be a pain point for implementations like PyPy that 
support both objects that move and a ctypes emulation.

As per Eryk Sun's reply, the "correct" way to get an object address is
by using ctypes.py_object.

Supporting py_object may be a pain point for other implementations
that emulate ctypes, but then again, so is supporting the whole
CPython C API (which is where the py_object type is needed, so it's
basically the same problem).

So to answer your question, I'd say that no, id() returning the object
address is not, and should not be, a guaranteed aspect of CPython, and
the motivating issue of ctypes is solved within ctypes itself by using
py_object.

Indeed -- I've been told by one developer in no uncertain terms that 
using id() in this fashion is the only way to get the address of an 
object for use in ctypes. I don't know enough about ctypes to judge 
whether that is correct or not.

The sample code I've been shown is this:

    pointer_to_obj = id(obj)
    from_deref = ctypes.cast(pointer_to_obj, ctypes.py_object).value
    from_deref is obj  # True

It's always worked, there's substantial code in the wild that depends
on it, and AFAICT it doesn't cause any real harm, so to me it seems
like the only possible conclusion is that CPython will continue to
guarantee this.

For this argument I don't think it matters whether it was originally
intentional, or whether there's some other alternative that people
could use in theory.

"Kind of dangerous?" How dangerous?

If I am reading this correctly, I think you are saying that using id() 
in this way is never(?) correct.

For me, the definitive answer is "yes, it's a CPython feature".

However, it's obviously not a PyPy feature, and I'm not sure about other
implementations.  Anything with an object model that can eliminate
in-memory objects in favour of in-register values (for example using
tagged pointers or type specialization + lifetime analysis) is obviously
not able to hold the promise that id() returns the /address/ of the
"object".

That doesn't mean the CPython feature has to live forever.  We may want
to deprecate it at some point (though it's not obvious how to warn the
user: just because you're using id() doesn't mean you're interested in
the actual /address/, rather than some arbitrary unique id).

> According to this claim, using id() to get the address for use in ctypes 
> is the correct and only way to do it

I don't know why you keep repeating that.  You were already explained
that it's /not/ the correct and only way to get the address for use in
ctypes.

Antoine.

Indeed.  I've used it for the same purpose in the past (identity-dict).

Sorry, I'm confused by your response here. As far as I can see, nobody 
except Eryk Sun gave any technical details about how to correctly pass 
objects to ctypes, so I'm not sure what sense of "get it wrong" you 
mean.

A couple of people offered the opinion that we ought to offer an 
explicit ctypes API for getting the address of an object, decoupling 
that functionality from id(). Do you mean "wrong" in the sense that such 
an API would be unnecessary, given the existing solution Eryk Sun 
quoted?

Its useful in all situations where you do topology preserving 
transformations, for example pickling (i.e. object serialization) or a 
deep copy of some object structures.

In these cases you need a way to record and quickly detect whether 
you've handled a specific object before. In Python we can do that with a 
dictionary that has object ids as keys. Java provides IdentityHashMap 
for that. Javascript provides neither, so deep-copying objects in 
Javascript seems to be impossible.

Whenever I've taught Python (quite a bit between writing, in person, and
webinars), I have been very explicit in stating that id(obj) returns some
unique number for each object, and mentioned that for MANY Python objects
CPython users an implementation convenience of using the memory address.

Every time I've explained it I've said not to rely on that implementation
detail. It's not true for small integers, for example, even in CPython.

Oh, bracket my brain glitch on small integers.  Yes, they still give id()
of memory address, they just get reused, which is different.  Nonetheless,
I never teach id(obj)
== ctypes.c_void_p.from_buffer(ctypes.py_object(b)).value ... and not only
because I only learned the latter spelling from eryk sun.

Isn't this what the ctypes.py_object type is for?

Also, any code that does anything with the address of an object
other than just pass it around is going to depend heavily on
the Python implementation being used, so the idea of an
implementation-independent way to deal with object addresses
seems problematic.

I didn't know about it when I posted that (as, I suspect, others also
didn't), and as others have pointed out, this is a prime target for a
docs update. Scanning the docs as of today does not suggest a better
way to do things.

That sounds dangerous. An id() is only valid as long as the object
it came from still exists, after which it can get re-used for a different
object. So when an object is flushed from your cache, you would have
to chase down all the places its id is being stored and eliminate them.

Are you sure you couldn't achieve the same thing more safely using
weak references?

The objects are the values in such a dict.

    thedict[id(obj)] is obj

Therefore the objects can't become garbage before id(obj) is deleted
from the dict.

The dict itself keeps the objects alive.

I can't say exactly what MRAB is doing.  I've done things "like that"
for decades, though, and have happily almost never used weakrefs.  I
wouldn't call my uses "caches", though - more like using dicts to
associate info with arbitrary objects (via using the object id as the
dict key), where the object implementations are out of my control and
don't properly support being used as dict keys.

This sometimes includes builtin mutable objects, like lists, or even
other dicts.

No such uses care about object addresses, though - just that id(obj)
returns a value usable as a dict key, unique among all reachable
objects at the time `id()` is called.

I'm not storing the id anywhere else.

I could've used a list for the cache, but then when I wanted to remove 
an object I'd have to search for it, O(n). Using a dict makes it O(1).

Yes, but the idea of a cache is that you're free to flush
things out of it to make room for something else without
breaking anything.

It sounds like MRAB is using ids as weak references,
without the assurance actual weak references give you
that they become invalidated when the refefenced object
goes away,

Yep. In hindsight it was probably a mistake for the docs
to talk about addresses in relation to id() -- it seems to
have given some people unrealistic expectations.

There's no need to use id() or casting to create a ctypes.py_object
instance, you can just call it:

 >>> obj = (1,2,3)
 >>> obj
(1, 2, 3)
 >>> p = ctypes.py_object(obj)
 >>> p
py_object((1, 2, 3))
 >>> p.value
(1, 2, 3)
 >>> p.value is obj
True

"Cache" was the wrong word for what it does. I'm not using the id as a 
weak reference.

Sometimes I might want to store a collection of objects and their order 
isn't important. I can add an object to the collection, or remove an 
object from it.

If I used a list, adding would be quick, but removing would require 
searching the list.

By putting them in a dict, keyed by the id, I can remove an object in O(1).

Trust me, I'm not doing anything that's unreliable! (And I _have_ done 
programming in C with the Python API, so I know all about refcounts...) :-)

I take that back. Dangerous is too strong of a word. It can be managed
if we're careful to avoid expressions like c_function(id(f())). Using
py_object simply avoids that problem.

Bear with me while I make a few more comments about py_object, even
though it's straying off topic.

For a type "O" argument (i.e. py_object is in the function's
`argtypes`), we might be able to borrow the reference from the
argument tuple. As implemented, however, the argument actually keeps
its own reference. For example, we can observe this by calling the
from_param method:

    >>> b = bytearray(b'spam')
    >>> arg = ctypes.py_object.from_param(b)
    >>> print(arg)
    <cparam 'O' at 0x7f32a49699b0>
    >>> print(arg._obj)
    bytearray(b'spam')

This is due to the type "O" setfunc, which needs to keep a reference
to the object when setting the value of a py_object instance. The
reference is stored as the _objects attribute. (For non-simple pointer
and aggregate types, _objects is instead a dict keyed by the index as
a hexadecimal string.)

(The getfunc and setfunc of a simple ctypes object are called to get
and set the value, which also includes cases in which we don't have an
actual py_object instance, such as function call arguments; pointer
and array indexes; and struct and union fields. These functions are
defined in Modules/_ctypes/cfield.c.)

IMO, a downside of py_object is that it's a simple type, so the
getfunc gets called automatically when getting fields or indexes. This
is annoying for py_object since a NULL value raises ValueError.
Returning None in this case isn't possible, in contrast to other
simple pointer types. We can work around this by subclassing
py_object. For example:

    >>> a1 = (ctypes.py_object * 1)()
    >>> a1[0]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ValueError: PyObject is NULL

    py_object = type('py_object', (ctypes.py_object,), {})

    >>> a2 = (py_object * 1)()
    >>> a2[0]
    <py_object object at 0x7f10dc7d9158>

Then, like all ctypes pointers, a false boolean value means it's NULL:

    >>> bool(a2[0])
    False
    >>> a2[0] = b'spam'
    >>> bool(a2[0])
    True

py_object doesn't help if a library holds onto the pointer and tries
to use it later on. For example, with Python's C API there are
functions that 'steal' a reference (with the assumption that it's a
newly created object, in which case it's more like 'claiming'), such
as PyTuple_SetItem. In this case, we need to increment the reference
count via Py_IncRef.

py_object can be returned from a callback without leaking a reference,
assuming the library manages the new reference. In contrast, other
types that need memory support have to leak a reference (e.g.
c_wchar_p, i.e. type "Z", needs a capsule object for the wchar_t
buffer). In case of a leak, we get warned with RuntimeWarning('memory
leak in callback function.').

> in this way is never(?) correct.

Yes, it's incorrect, but I've been guilty of using id() like this,
too, because it's convenient. Perhaps we could provide a function
that's explicitly specified to return the address, if implemented.
Maybe call it sys.getaddress()?

In my first reply, I provided two alternatives that use ctypes to
return the address instead of id(). So there's that as well. The fine
print is that ctypes is optional in the standard library. Platforms
and implementations don't have to support it.

Hmm...  That sounds nonsensical to me. By construction, if you're able
to get a reference to an object in pure Python, then the object is
alive.

(by pure Python I'm excluding ctypes hacks or the exploitation of bugs
in the CPython object implementation)

By the way, you can also have a WeakValueDictionary where keys are ids
and values are the corresponding objects, if you need both identity
lookup and weak references.

Antoine.

Hi Serhiy,

That's terrible and sounds frightening. Were you able to get medical
care to get a diagnosis and treatment if needed?

We all hope your condition improves.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Sub-interpreters: importing numpy causes hang
Message-ID: <CAFctytKDsnVyOY9_23DspQRFkFjQCH9VambJ=-y2f+S0B=AwEg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all!

I am new to the list and arriving with a concrete problem that I'd
like to fix myself.

I am embedding Python (3.6) into my C++ application and I would like
to run Python scripts isolated from each other using sub-interpreters.
I am not using threads; everything is supposed to run in the
application's main thread.

I noticed that if I create an interpreter, switch to it and execute
code that imports numpy (1.13), my application will hang.

Numpy's extension umath calls PyGILState_Ensure(), which in turn calls
PyEval_RestoreThread on the (auto) threadstate of the main
interpreter. And that's wrong.
We are already holding the GIL with the threadstate of our current
sub-interpreter, so there's no need to switch.

I know that the GIL API is not fully compatible with sub-interpreters,
as issues #10915 and #15751 illustrate.

But since I need to support calls to PyGILState_Ensure - numpy is the
best example -, I am trying to improve the situation here:
https://github.com/stephanreiter/cpython/commit/d9d3451b038af2820f500843b6a88f57270e1597

That change may be naive, but it does the trick for my use case. If
totally wrong, I don't mind pursuing another alley.

Essentially, I'd like to ask for some guidance in how to tackle this
problem while keeping the current GIL API unchanged (to avoid breaking
modules).

I am also wondering how I can test any changes I am proposing. Is
there a test suite for interpreters, for example?

Thank you very much,
Stephan

That's a pity.

Note that there is a patch on https://bugs.python.org/issue10915 that
could probably solve the issue if it had been applied some years ago ;-)

(yes, it needs C extension authors to use the new API, but Numpy is a
well-maintained library and would probably have accepted a patch for
that; so would Cython probably)

I'm not aware of any solution which does not require designing a new
API, unfortunately.

You'll find a couple of them in test_embed.py, test_capi.py and
test_threading.py.

Antoine.

There are currently numerous incompatibilities between numpy and
subinterpreters, and no concrete plan for fixing them. The numpy team does
not consider subinterpreters to be a supported configuration, and can't
help you with any issues you run into. I know the concept of
subinterpreters is really appealing, but unfortunately the CPython
implementation is not really mature or widely supported... are you
absolutely certain you need to use subinterpreters for your application?

Subject: [Python-Dev] Source of truth for C-API
Message-ID: <CAOMjWkmVTdNyhkotcoBn08z_hS7d-tk393xEvaOrMKPFFreLKw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I recently modified signatures of two functions PyNode_AddChild() and
PyParser_AddToken().
These two functions are not listed in C-API docs on docs.python.org, and
are not included in Python.h. However, their names look like they may be
part of C-API. So there appeared a question, what is the source of truth
for C-API, is there an official list? Or is it just the content of Python.h?

I consider that frameobject.h is also part of the C API, even if it's
not included by Python.h. For example, PyFrame_GetLineNumber() is part
of the C API, it's just that you have to explicitly #include
"frameobject.h".

I'm not aware of any tool to automatically list the content of the C API.

Counter example: PyFrame_New() is not documented. But I still consider
it to be part of the C API.

... Yeah, the definition of the "C API" is unclear to most peole :-)

Thanks for the answers so far. I appreciate them!

Nathaniel, I'd like to allow Python plugins in my application. A
plugin should be allowed to bring its own modules along (i.e.
plugin-specific subdir is in sys.path when the plugin is active) and
hence some isolation of them will be needed, so that they can use
different versions of a given module. That's my main motivation for
using subinterpreters.
I thought about running plugins out-of-processes - a separate process
for every plugin - and allow them to communicate with my application
via RPC. But that makes it more complex to implement the API my
application will offer and will slow down things due to the need to
copy data.
Maybe you have another idea for me? :)

Henry, Antoine, thanks for your input; I'll check out the tests and
see what I can learn from issue 10915.

Not really, sorry! I believe that most applications that support
Python plugins (like blender, gimp, libreoffice, etc.), do it by using
a single shared environment for all plugins. This is also how every
application written in Python works, so at the ecosystem level there's
a lot of pressure on module authors to make it possible to assemble
them into a single coherent environment.

The shell script attached to https://bugs.python.org/issue23903 should
be able to do it with different preprocessor values (we originally
intended to detect inconsistencies in the stable API, but when we found
lots of existing inconsistencies we couldn't agree on how to deal with
them).

Cheers,
Steve

Try to make the plugins work together. Look into using pip/PyPI for your 
plugins. Try to make it so each package ("plugin") would have only one 
module/package, and dependencies would be other packages that can be 
installed individually and shared. And keep in mind you can set up your 
own package index, or distribute/install individual package files.

If that's not possible, and you want things to work now, go with subprocess.

If you want to help make subinterpreters work better, there are several 
people scratching at the problem from different angles. Most/all would 
welcome help, but don't expect any short-term benefits.
(FWIW, my own effort is currently blocked on PEP 580, and I hope to move 
forward after a Council is elected.)

Thanks for advice Victor and Steve!

I looked at the list, and the two functions I mentioned are not in the
list. So I assume the best strategy for now is to wait until first
alpha-beta releases are out, and see if anyone complains.

Hi!

Well, the plugins would be created by third-parties and I'd like them
to enable bunding of modules with their plugins.
I am afraid of modules with the same name, but being different, or
different versions of modules being used by different plugins. If
plugins share an interpreter, the module with a given name that is
imported first sticks around forever and for all plugins.

I am thinking about this design:
- Plugins don't maintain state in their Python world. They expose
functions, my application calls them.
- Everytime I call into them, they are presented with a clean global
namespace. After the call, the namespace (dict) is thrown away. That
releases any objects the plugin code has created.
- So, then I could also actively unload modules they loaded. But I do
know that this is problematic in particular for modules that use
native code.

I am interested in both a short-term and a long-term solution.
Actually, making subinterpreters work better is pretty sexy ...
because it's hard. :-)

I suggest you to add a new function and leaves the existing function
unchanged. "Just in case".

You may deprecate the old functions at the same time using Py_DEPRECATED().

That is great!  Statements like that are a good way to get folks
interested in your success. :)

FYI, running multiple interpreters in the same (e.g. main) thread
isn't as well thought out as running them in separate threads.  There
may be assumptions in the runtime that would cause crashes or
inconsistency in the runtime, so be vigilant.  Is there a reason not
to run the subinterpreters in separate threads?

Regarding isolation, keep in mind that there are some limitations.  At
an intrinsic level subinterpreters are never truly isolated since they
run in the same process.  This matters if you have concerns about
security (which you should always consider) and stability (if a
subinterpreter crashes then your whole process crashes).  You can find
that complete isolation via subprocess & multiprocessing.

On top of intrinsic isolation, currently subinterpreters have gaps in
isolation that need fixing.  For instance, they share a lot of
module-global state, as well as builtin types and singletons.  So data
can leak between subinterpreters unexpectedly.

Finally, at the Python level subinterpreters don't have a good way to
pass data around.  (I'm working on that. [1])  Naturally at the C
level you can keep pointers to objects and share data that way.  Just
keep in mind that doing so relies on the GIL (in an
interpreter-per-thread scenario, which you're avoiding).  In a world
where subinterpreters don't share the GIL [2] (and you're running one
interpreter per thread) you'll end up with refcounting races, leading
to crashes.  Just keep that mind if you decide to switch to
one-subinterpreter-per-thread.

That's an interesting approach.  Using subinterpreters would indeed
give you isolation between the sets of imported modules.

As you noticed, you'll run into some problems when extension modules
are involved.  There aren't any great workarounds yet .
Subinterpreters are tied pretty tightly to the core runtime so it's
hard to attack the problem from the outside.  Furthermore,
subinterpreters aren't widely used yet so folks haven't been very
motivated to fix the runtime.  (FWIW, that is changing.)

Yep.  It might be worth it though.  Note that running
plugins/extensions in separate processes is a fairly common approach
for a variety of solid technical reasons (e.g. security, stability).
FWIW, there are some tools available (or soon to be) for sharing data
more efficiently (e.g. shared memory in multiprocessing, PEP 574)

* single proc -- keep using subinterpreters
  + dlmopen or the Windows equivalent (I hesitate to suggest this
hack, but it might help somewhat with extension modules)
  + help fix the problems with subinterpreters :)
* single proc -- no subinterpreters
  + import hook to put plugins in their own namespace (tricky with
extension modules)
  + extend importlib to do the same
  + swap sys.modules in and out around plugin use
* multi-proc -- one process per plugin
  + subprocess
  + multiprocessing

Petr noted that a number of people are working on getting
subinterpreters to a good place.  That includes me. [1][2] :)  We'd

You all do make me feel very welcome in this community! Thank you very much! :-)

And thank you for all the thought and time you put into your message,
Eric. I do appreciate in particular all the alternatives you
presented; you provide a good picture of my options.
Not ruling out any of them, I'll stick with (single process + multiple
subinterpreters + plugins can't keep state in Python + all my Python
calls are performed on the main thread) for the time being. That's
quite a limited environment, which I hope I can make work in the long
run. And I think the concept of subinterpreters is nice and I'd like
to spend some time on the challenge of improving the situation.

So, I updated my changes and have the following on top of 3.6.1 at the moment:
https://github.com/stephanreiter/cpython/commit/c1afa0c8cdfab862f409f1c7ff02b189f5191cbe

I did what Henry suggested and ran the Python test suite. On Windows,
with my changes I get as output:

357 tests OK.

2 tests failed:
    test_re test_subprocess

46 tests skipped:
    test_bz2 test_crypt test_curses test_dbm_gnu test_dbm_ndbm
    test_devpoll test_epoll test_fcntl test_fork1 test_gdb test_grp
    test_idle test_ioctl test_kqueue test_lzma test_nis test_openpty
    test_ossaudiodev test_pipes test_poll test_posix test_pty test_pwd
    test_readline test_resource test_smtpnet test_socketserver
    test_spwd test_sqlite test_ssl test_syslog test_tcl
    test_threadsignals test_timeout test_tix test_tk test_ttk_guionly
    test_ttk_textonly test_turtle test_urllib2net test_urllibnet
    test_wait3 test_wait4 test_winsound test_xmlrpc_net test_zipfile64

Total duration: 6 min 20 sec
Tests result: FAILURE

I dropped my changes and ran the test suite again using vanilla Python
and got the same result.
So, it seems that the change doesn't break anything that is tested,
but that probably doesn't mean a lot.

Tomorrow, I'll investigate the following situation if I find time:

If we create a fresh OS thread and make it call PyGILState_Ensure, it
won't have a PyThreadState saved under autoTLSkey. That means it will
create one using the main interpreter. I, as the developer embedding
Python into my application and using multiple interpreters, have no
control here. Maybe I know that under current conditions a certain
other interpreter should be used.

I'll try to provoke this situation and then introduce a callback from
Python into my application that will allow me to specify which
interpreter should be used, e.g. code as follows:

PyInterpreter *pickAnInterpreter() {
  return activePlugin ? activePlugin->interpreter : nullptr; //
nullptr maps to main interpreter
}

PyGILState_SetNewThreadInterpreterSelectionCallback(&pickAnInterpreter);

Maybe rubbish. But I think a valuable experiment that will give me a
better understanding.

You have been a marvel, and an enormous boon to the Python community.? 
You should not feel bad about anything.? Best wishes to you for your 
future endeavors!

Like everyone else, I am sorry to hear this news, and extend my sympathies.
It's marvellous that you are still able to work on Python at all, still.
Since you have to be careful not to do too much, you will just have to
choose your battles carefully. Thank you for your many contributions to
Python to date.

Kind regards
 Steve

Subject: [Python-Dev] Add more SyntaxWarnings?
Message-ID: <q2d6i0$63gm$1@blaine.gmane.org>

https://bugs.python.org/issue15248 is about situations like the following:

 >>> [(1,2,3)
      (4,5,6)]
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<pyshell#4>", line 2, in <module>
     (4,5,6)]
TypeError: 'tuple' object is not callable

The original poster requested that the error message be augmented with 
something like "(missing preceding comma?)"

Ezio Melotti suggested a FAQ entry like
https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#why-am-i-getting-an-unboundlocalerror-when-the-variable-has-a-value

(I think such entries below in a separate doc and will try to post on 
python-ideas when I have a prototype.)

Serhiy Storchaka suggested a compiler SyntaxWarning and uploaded a 
proof-of-concept diff that handled the above and many similar cases. The 
diff is based on the idea that while we can only positively identify 
'callables' at runtime, we *can* negatively identify many non-callables 
when compiling.  Ditto for subscriptables and indexables.

Serhiy concluded with
"This patch was inspired by usability improvements in GCC 8.
https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/03/15/gcc-8-usability-improvements/
I haven't created a pull request because I have doubts about that this 
should be in the compiler rather of a third-party linter. But if several 
other core developers will support this idea I'll continue working in 
this direction."

I was impressed with how clear and readable the patch is and consider it 
a plausible enhancement.  I would like other core developers to comment.

If your primary concern is module clashes between plugins, maybe you
can hack around that:

1) if the plugins are providing copies of any other modules, then you
can simply require them to put them in their own namespace ? that is,
a plug-in is a single package, with however many sub modules as it may
need.

2) if plugins might require third party packages that need to be
isolated, then maybe you could use an import hook that
re-names/isolates the modules each plugin loads, so they are kept
separate.

I haven?t thought through how to do any of this, but in principle, you
can have the same module loaded twice if it has a different name.


Not that sub interpreters aren?t cool and useful, but you can probably
handle module clashes in a simpler way.

I believe that in general we should give better errors or warnings
if we can do it without huge difficulty.  Serhiy's patch is quite
simple.  The same check *could* be done by a linting tool.  Putting
it in CPython will make it more widely available.  These checks
could be helpful to beginners who probably won't have linting tools
setup.

I think we should not make it an error, otherwise we have changed
Python "the language".  We don't want to force other Python
implementations to do the same check.  It might be hard for them to
implement.  So, SyntaxWarning seems like a reasonable compromise.

  Neil

In this case I agree that a SyntaxWarning is a good idea, per Serhiy's
patch. I would be even more conservative, and only warn if the first object
is a tuple -- the case of the missing comma in the original example appears
likely enough, but I don't expect people to write e.g. `[[1, 2], (3, 4)]`
very often, so leaving the comma out there would be very unlikely.

Regarding the issue of when it's appropriate to issue a SyntaxWarning vs.
when to leave it up to linters, again I would recommend great caution and
only warn about code that is *definitely* going to fail when executed. (Or
at least is *definitely* not going to please the programmer -- one of the
first cases where we added a SyntaxWarning was actually `assert(condition,
message)`, which "fails" by never failing. :-) But this is one of those
cases.

+1 to what Neil says here.

We're allowed to, we're the ones who say what the language is :-)


The remainder of my comments are more speculative.

> implement.  So, SyntaxWarning seems like a reasonable compromise.

We could say that implementations are allowed to raise errors at compile 
time instead of run time, but aren't required to. Then it becomes a 
matter of "quality of implementation".

For literal ints, strings, None, etc we can tell at compile time that an 
error will occur. All of these cannot fail to raise (short of changing 
the interpreter, in which case you're not using Python anymore):

    1 + "1"  # raises TypeError
    None[x]  # TypeError
    1.234(x)  # TypeError
    "spam".idnex("a")  # AttributeError

In these specific cases, there is nothing wrong with the *syntax*, but a 
compiler should be permitted to immediately raise the same exception 
that would otherwise occur at run time. This is a form of peephole 
optimization, I guess.

If people truly wanted to delay the exception, they could either turn 
off the peephole optimizer, or work around it:

    a = 1; a + "1"

Thoughts?

+1. If it's something that the peephole optimizer is already allowed
to change (eg "1"+"1" is constant-folded) and there is absolutely no
way that it can ever be changed at run time, then raising at compile
time can't hurt [1]. It'd be as implementation-dependent and
version-dependent as the peephole optimizer itself.

Does there need to be a new subclass of SyntaxError for "Technically
Valid But Not Meaningful" problems? Is there value in distinguishing
"InevitableTypeError" from "InevitableAttributeError"?

ChrisA

[1] Yes, I know about XKCD 1172, but if someone's saying "if
shouldnt_happen: None[None]" then that's their problem.

I'm -1 on all of these cases. There's nothing mysterious about e.g.
`TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'`, unlike the
case of the two concatenated tuples. (Surely people get errors about
int+str all the time, and they've never complained -- unlike the tuple
tuple case.)

I don't think there's a *general* problem to be solved here.

Well, yes, that particular example is pretty clear. But as a rule, there
are a LOT of errors that can be pretty mysterious to newbies.

I would love to see Python become generally more informative with errors.

In this case, you?d probably get a similar error, but it?s still nice to
get it sooner, and if the hooks are in place, We could have others that are
really helpful.

I don?t think so ? what we need are helpful error messages. If it will be
raised at compile time, then it won?t generally be catchable in s
try-except? so the actual exception type isn?t very important.

I doubt people are writing `42 + "abc"` by accident. They'll write `x + y`
and by accident the types won't match. So better error messages at runtime
would help. But I doubt we'll see much mileage out of the syntax checks.
And making things work different based on whether it's a literal or a
variable isn't very Pythonic.

It would be a change if the code is never called. I'm not sure we care 
about code that's never called, but it is a change.

At the cost of breaking threading a bit, I'm going to reply to a few 
different people in one post.

If we did this (which is looking less and less likely...) I would argue 
for plain old TypeError and AttributeError. There should be no 
difference in the exception raised, only in the timing (compile time 
versus run time).

That is precisely my thinking.

Its not about the error being mysterious, its about raising the 
exception as early as possible. It shouldn't take 20 years to discover 
that this snippet buried deep in a large code base:

    if datetime.date.today().year == 2029:
        spam = 1 + '1'

will fail :-)

Frankly, I agree, so I'm not going to argue hard for this. It was more 
speculation than a solid proposal.

A project manager I used to work with would have dismissed this as "turd 
polishing", but I prefer to think of it as "craftsmanship" -- a bit like 
a carpenter ensuring that his screws don't protrude above the surface of 
the wood. Sure, its not going to hold the wood together any better, but 
its just a nicer end-user experience :-)

I expect that the cost of implementing these checks would probably 
exceed the benefit of detecting the errors early, but I could be wrong. 
Maybe it would be easy to implement.

But if there is strong opposition to it, I'm not going to champion the 
idea any further.

Isn't that the very definition of "newbie"?  That's half a joke, but I
really don't think that programmers new to Python should be the
standard.  The problematic cases are those where even a relatively
experienced Python programmer needs to be told why an error is raised,
because it's too hard to figure out from background knowledge of the
language, you need to know about implementation internals.

I would love to see all automated systems become more informative with
errors!  One thing I like about Python the development community is
that people are doing something about it.  Slowly but surely ....

In general depending much on exception type is a hit-or-miss affair.

Hi folks,

I'm currently seeing a behaviour where every time I run "make html",
all 474 source files get rebuilt.

For now, I'm assuming I've messed something up with my local docs
build setup, but figured I'd ask if anyone else was seeing this, in
case it was actually broken at the build level (CI wouldn't pick this
up, since it always builds from scratch anyway).

Cheers,
Nick.

And potentially put an underscore in front of the new ones (or even
hide them behind Py_BUILD_CORE).

Some of these older APIs are only public because the modern
conventions we use for hiding implementation details weren't
established yet.

That actually sounds like a pretty plausible approach to me, at least
for cases where the embedding application maintains some other state
that lets it know which interpreter a new thread should be associated
with. The best aspect of it is that it would let the embedding
application decide how to handle registration of previously unknown
threads with the Python runtime *without* requiring that all existing
extension modules switch to a new thread registration API first.

I'll pass the concept along to Graham Dumpleton (author of the
mod_wsgi module for Apache httpd) to see if an interface like this
might be enough to resolve some of the major compatibility issues
mod_wsgi currently encounters with subinterpreters.

Cheers,
Nick.

The biggest problem with converting runtime errors to compile time
errors is that it means affected dead code goes from being a
readability & maintainability problem to "Python X.Y breaks my
project".

SyntaxWarning splits the difference nicely, since the compiler
complains about the same dead code that would confuse a human reader,
but also ignores it and moves on.

Cheers,
Nick.

Cool. Thanks, Nick!

I did experiments based on this idea (
https://github.com/stephanreiter/cpython/commit/3bca91c26ac81e517b4aa22302be1741b3315622)
and haven't rejected it yet. :-)

Together with the other fix (
https://github.com/stephanreiter/cpython/commit/c1afa0c8cdfab862f409f1c7ff02b189f5191cbe),
numpy at least is happy in my Python-hosting app.

I will pursue the idea of swapping sys.modules in a single Interpreter now
because that wouldn't require patching Python and I might get the mileage
out of this approach I need.

Still interested in improving sub-interpreters, though. I just need to
balance short and long term solution. :-)

Stephan

I just rebuilt, ditto, all 474.  Caching only works when I rebuild 
'soon' (at least within same day) after a complete rebuild.  I just 
updated and only function.rst was changed and only function.html and the 
indexes were rebuilt.

I think something is broken.  Caching used to work better.

So again, just to make sure you're aware, even if it looks like it's
working right now, there are definitely many subtle ways that numpy will
break when used in a subinterpreter and this configuration is not supported
by the numpy devs. If you discover later that there's some strange crash,
or even that you've been getting incorrect results for months without
noticing, then the numpy devs will be sympathetic but will probably close
your bugs without further investigation.

This is dangerous for extension modules.  C is a single global space
unrelated to Python module names that cannot be isolated without
intentionally building and linking each desired extension module statically
and configured not to export its own symbols (no-export-dynamic).  Non
trivial.

Suggesting importing the same extension module multiple times under
different Python sys.modules names is a recipe for disaster.  Most
extension module code is not written with that in mind.  So while *some*
things happen to "work", many others blow up in unexpected hard to debug
ways.

They're a cool and useful theory... but I really do not recommend their use
for code importing other libraries expecting to be isolated.  CPython
doesn't offer multiple isolated runtimes in a process today.

In my case, I had an older version of blurb installed, which was
keeping NEWS from rendering properly, and I suspect that was
preventing Sphinx from marking the cache as valid.

I'm not sure about that theory though, as I would have expected an
invalid NEWS file to only keep the NEWS file from being cached.

Cheers,
Nick.

After talking to Graham about this, I unfortunately realised that the
reason the callback approach is appearing to work for you is because
your application is single-threaded, so you can readily map any
invocation of the callback to the desired interpreter. Multi-threaded
applications won't have that luxury - they need to be able to set the
callback target on a per-thread basis.

Graham actually described a plausible approach for doing that several
years back: https://bugs.python.org/issue10915#msg126387

We have much better subinterpreter testing support now, so if this is
any area that you're interested in, one potential place to start would
be to get Antoine's patch back to a point where it applies and
compiles again.

Cheers,
Nick.

Reading through that post, I think I have everything covered but this here:
- The third and final scenario, and the one where the extended GIL
state functions for Ensure is still required, is where code doesn't
have the GIL as yet and wants to make a call into sub interpreter
rather than the main interpreter, where it already has a pointer to
the sub interpreter and nothing more. In this case the new
PyGILState_EnsureEx() function is used, with the sub interpreter being
passed as argument.

If I understand it correctly, it means the following in practice:
Whenever I or a third-party library start a new thread, we need to
query what interpreter we are running at the moment (in the thread
that is starting the new thread) and pass that information on to the
new thread so that it can initialize the GIL for itself.

Pseudo code ahead:
void do_in_thread(func_t *what) {
  PyThreadState* state = PyThreadState_Get(); /// or new
PyInterpreterState_Current();
  PyInterpreterState *interpreter = state->interp;
  std::thread t([what, interpreter] {
    auto s = PyGILState_EnsureEx(interpreter);
    what();
    PyGILState_Release(s); // could also release before what() because
TLS was updated and next PyGILState_Ensure() will work
  });
}

Did I get that right?

I've often noticed oddities in Sphinx caching on other projects.
I'm not sure the algorithm is extremely precise.

Yeah, I think that's the essence of it, although the other case that
can come up is when the parent thread just created a new
subinterpreter (that only changes how it acquires the pointer though -
the challenge of getting a child thread to make proper use of that
pointer remains the same).

Cheers,
Nick.

Python is broadly advocated (and used) as a first language to learn.
Because it is.

So I think anything we can do to help newbies, *that doesn?t make the
language less powerful, or even more annoying for experienced
developers* is a good thing.

That is: prioritizing newbie-friendliness is good. Prioritizing it
over other important things is not.

I don't disagree.  I disagree with the conclusion that it's worth the
effort to try to improve all error messages that confuse new users,
because new users (by definition) don't know enough to respond
usefully in many cases.  In those cases, they need to be told what's
going on and why, where more experienced users can figure it out from
their background knowledge of Python semantics.  Embedding a "theory
of operations" note in every error message would be possible, but I
don't think it's a good idea -- it would certainly make the language
more annoying for experienced developers.

That's why I proposed the criterion

Maybe that's too strict.  The pleasant hacks of giving ``quit`` and
``help`` "values" as variables are certainly useful.  On the contrary,
getting rid of the print statement was perhaps a better idea. :-)

FWIW, we have pretty decent evidence that error messages don't have to
provide a wonderful explanation on their own in order to be helpful:
they just need to be distinctive enough that a web search will
reliably get you to a page that gives you relevant information.

Pre-seeded answers on Stack Overflow are excellent for handling the
second half of that approach (see [1] for a specific example).

Cheers,
Nick.

I have a vague recollection that a certain computer system (Amiga?) had 
a 'why' command. If it reported an error, you could type "why" and it 
would give you more details.

I suspect that all that was happening was that when the error occurred 
it would store the additional details somewhere that the 'why' command 
would simply retrieve.

Well, a typical Linux install includes "errno" util:

$ errno 13
EACCES 13 Permission denied

So, hail to error numbers. And indeed, even if some may think they're
artifact of 1980'ies, they're alive, well, and useful:

$ pylint --help-msg W1651
:deprecated-itertools-function (W1651): *Accessing a deprecated function on the itertools module*
  Used when accessing a function on itertools that has been removed in Python 3.
  This message belongs to the python3 checker. It can't be emitted when using
  Python >= 3.0.

Subject: [Python-Dev] [ANN] "compiler" package resurrected
Message-ID: <20190130205406.10253578@x230>

Hello,

I'm sorry for posting here and not to python-announce, somehow I think
(perhaps naively) that it may be of interest to people who are
interested in Python development. At the very least, creation of the
original package is (very likely, I didn't trace up to that) was
discussed on python-dev, its removal was discussed on python-dev, so
why revival of it can't be noted here?

Because, turns out, in old good times, there was a bytecode compiler
written in Python, and even as a part of stdlib. Well, actually it's
still there in the latest 2.7 release, with a proud notice: "Remove
in Python3". The point is that I'm with Python since 1.5 times, and
never knew about this package. I'd generally consider that to be
something to be ashamed and hush of, but unfortunately I found that to
be recurring pattern: people interested in playing with a Python
compiler discover "by a chance" and "suddenly" that they should look no
beyond the stdlib for their (usually pretty simple for starters) needs
- oftentimes, after they already started on the more effortful path
(I faithfully spent 2 days on trying to extract a bytecode compiler
from PyPy first). 

With that intro, here's it - the port of Python2 compiler package
(https://docs.python.org/2/library/compiler.html) to Python3:

https://github.com/pfalcon/python-compiler

Currently, it generates bytecode compatible with CPython3.5, and is
able to compile its entire Lib/ (which includes not just stdlib modules
per se, but also tests, and the real "teeth-cracking" stuff is there of
course), except for test_super.py, for which current implementation's
teeth are indeed too weak yet.  

Now that it passes the compile-stdlib test, the idea is to refactor
it into something which can be easily played with and extended. We'll
see how it goes.

As one of the example of what's intended to be easily done with it, see
thread
https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2019-January/155991.html .
I started it when updating the codegen for Python3, but also shows the
intended purpose - it would easy to analyze if an except handler body
contains "del exc" and if not, skip generating superfluous bytecode.

So ? are you suggesting to use the webbrowser module inside of the REPL to
look up the exception message of the previously printed stack trace in
stack overflow when a user types "why()"?

I faintly recall someone implementing something in that direction. It's
probably in some package on PyPI.

No, I was just suggesting it as a possible way of providing newbies with 
more information about an error without annoying more experienced users 
with excessively long messages every time.

   It doesn't have to be all web. Compare how ``help()`` works at the
python REPL, ``pydoc name`` at the command line, and
``pydoc -p`` + a browser.

Subject: [Python-Dev] How to update namedtuple asdict() to use dict instead
 of OrderedDict
Message-ID: <DEEE3FD0-450E-4AD8-BA8E-87FDF6E0E8EB@gmail.com>

Now that regular dicts are ordered and compact, it makes more sense for the _asdict() method to create a regular dict (as it did in its early days) rather than an OrderedDict.  The regular dict is much smaller, much faster, and has a much cleaner looking repr.  It would also help namedtuple() stay in sync with dataclasses which already take advantage of the ordering feature of regular dicts.

The question is how to be go about making the change in a way gives the most benefit to users as soon as possible and that creates the least disruption.

Option 1) Add a deprecation notice to 3.8, make no code change in 3.8, and then update the code in 3.9.  This has several issues: a) it doesn't provide an executable DeprecationWarning in 3.8, b) it isn't really a deprecation, and c) it defers the benefits of the change for another release.

Option 2) Add a deprecation notice to 3.8, add a DeprecationWarning to the _asdict() method, and make the actual improvement in 3.9.  The main issue here is that it will create a lot of noise for normal uses of the _asdict() method which are otherwise unaffected by the change. The typical use cases for _asdict() are to create keyword arguments and to pass named tuple data into functions or methods that expect regular dictionaries.  Those use cases would benefit from seeing the change made sooner and would suffer in the interim from their code slowing down for warnings that aren't useful.

Option 3). Add a deprecation notice to 3.8 and have the _asdict() method create a subclass of OrderedDict that issues warnings only for the methods and attributes that will change (move_to_end, popitem, __eq__, __dict__, __weakref__).  This is less noisy but it adds a lot of machinery just to make a notification of a minor change.  Also, it fails to warn that the data type will change.  And it may create more confusion than options 1 and 4 which are simpler.

Option 4) Just make the change directly in 3.8,  s/OrderedDict/dict/, and be done will it.  This gives users the benefits right away and doesn't annoy them with warnings that they likely don't care about.   There is some precedent for this.  To make namedtuple class creation faster, the *verbose* option was dropped without any deprecation period.  It looks like no one missed that feature at all, but they did get the immediate benefit of faster import times.  In the case of using regular dicts in named tuples, people will get immediate and significant space savings as well as a speed benefit.

My recommendation is Option 4 as being less disruptive and more beneficial than the other options.  In the unlikely event that anyone is currently depending on the reordering methods for the output of _asdict(), the remediation is trivially simple:   nt._asdict() -> OrderedDict(nt.as_dict()).

What do you all think?


Raymond

Message-ID: <CAE_HWMtAwJLsYLv5rkrJtqFi_rFekNq7+X+hd36ihDAtDecsRQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Python community folk!

As we've done for the past many years, Python is hoping to participate
in Google Summer of Code.  This is a neat program where students write
code over the (northern hemisphere) summer under the tutelage of open
source mentors and get paid: we provide the project ideas, mentors and
choose the students, Google provides the program framework and the money
to pay students.  You can read more about GSoC here:
https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/

Python participates as an "umbrella org" where many different smaller
projects ("sub orgs") that use Python can take part under our banner.
You can also participate separately, but for people who've never done it
before and want help or for whom the paperwork is a hassle, you're
welcome to join up with us and let us show you the ropes!

It's really fun, and we've gotten lots of new contributors to
Python-based projects over the years, taking in as many as 70+ students
in a single year.  Last year we only had 15, though, so we've got lots
of space for new mentors and new projects.

We didn't have any projects for core python last year as there were no
mentors
for the projects, so if anyone is interested in mentoring this year let us
know asap!

You can also send questions to gsoc-admins at python.org (or just hit reply
to this email!)

Option 4 sounds good to me.

Would it be practical to add deprecated methods to regular dict for the 
OrderedDict reordering methods that raise with an error suggesting "To 
use this method, convert dict to OrderedDict." (or some better wording).

+1 on option 4.  I agree with everyone else.  Because the remediation that
keeps code compatible across all versions is that simple, just go with
option 4.  We document that in What's New and be done with it. :)

Thanks for the excellent write up, Raymond.

> Option 1) Add a deprecation notice to 3.8 [?]

In general, I don?t favor deprecation notices for things that are not actionable by the end user or the consumer of the API in question.  It ends up being just noise, and that?s one of the big reasons why they are silenced by default (i.e. the end user of a Python application can?t do anything about the deprecation, so why scare them?).

Maybe we need something like a MinorBehavioralChangeWarning which would be surfaced similar to PendingDeprecationWarning, but which says ?Hey, we changed this in the current version of Python.  Be aware of that change, but you probably don?t need to do anything about it?.  At least such warnings could be reviewed, documented, and audited.

I suppose in this case, there is something the consumer of the API can do (as you point out, they can wrap their code), but in all likelihood there?s really nothing they *need* to do.  I think it will be rare that a Python 3.8 user will get bitten by this.  Therefore...

How viable would it be to make OrderedDict smaller, faster, and give
it a cleaner looking repr?

Thanks everyone.  I'll move forward with option 4.  In Barry's word, JFDI :-)

Not so much.  The implementations substantially different because they have different superpowers.  A regular dict is really good at being a dict while retaining order but it isn't good at reordering operations such as popitem(False), popitem(True), move_to_end(), and whatnot.  An OrderedDict is a heavier weight structure (a hash table augmented by a doubly-linked link) -- it is worse at being a dictionary but really good at intensive reordering operations typical in cache recency tracking and whatnot.  Also, there are long-standing API differences including weak references, ability to assign attributes, an equality operation that requires exact order when compared to another ordered dict etc, as well as the reordering methods.  If it was easy, clean, and desirable, it would have already been done :-)  Overall, I think the OrderedDict is increasingly irrelevant except for use cases requiring cross-version compatibility and for cases that need heavy reordering.  Accordingly, I mostly expect to leave it alone and fall into the not-much-used category like UserDict, UserList, and UserString.

That's an interesting idea.  Regular dicts aren't well suited to the reordering operations (like lists, repeated inserts at the front of the sequence wouldn't be performant relative to OrderedDict which uses double-linked lists internally).  My instinct is to leave regular dicts alone so that they can focus on their primary task (being good a fast lookups).

Alternatively, would it be viable to make OrderedDict work in a way that so
long as you don't use any reordering operations it's essentially just a
very thin layer on top of a dict, but if you do use any reordering
operations, it adds in the additional heavyweight structure required to
support that?

I'm pretty sure something similar has been considered before, but thought I
should bring it up in the context of this discussion (if only to have to
shot down).

There's all kinds of tricks we could do but none of them are worth it.  It took Eric Snow a long time to write the OrderedDict patch and it took years to get most of the bugs out of it.  I would really hate to go through a redesign and eat up our time for something that probably won't be much used any more.

I'm really just aiming for something as simple as s/OrderedDict/dict in namedtuple :-)

My goal was just to give a meaningful error message if someone misses 
the implications in What's New, and has code that actually does expect 
named_tuple.as_dict to have the ordering operations.

The added, deprecated methods could be removed after a couple of versions.

 to regular dict?
Message-ID: <CAEfz+TyQBiP-1HM41tz0EiT_eVtrY9jOuiTWdHnjUKnbQQfgiA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

csv.DictReader uses OrderedDict by default, from Python 3.6.
But it doesn't make sense anymore, like namedtuple._asdict().
How about changing default dict type back to regular dict.

Python is widely used for handling learge data.  So I think
changing default dict type to OrderedDict was performance
and memory usage regression in 3.6.

Additionally, configparser uses OrderedDict by default from Python 3.6 too.

I am not sure about `parser['section1'] == parser['section2']` is not used yet.
But we broke it once in 3.6 by changing dict to OrderedDict.  Are there any
issue report caused by this backward incompatibility?

And I think performance and memory efficiency is not so important for
configparser, unlike csv.

I'm

* +1 about changing csv.DictReader's default dict type
* +0.5 about changing configparser's default dict type.

How do you think?

Regards,

Option 4 here as well.  Sometimes perfection is the enemy of the good.

I submitted the patch to make the csv module use an OrderedDict in
DictReader. It doesn't, AFAIR, use anything but the ordering property of
ordered dict, so the reversion to a simple dict should be perfectly OK as
long as no consumers have started to make use of specific OrderedDict
properties.

You may be thinking of Doug Hellman's https://pypi.org/project/whatthewhat/

Cheers,
Nick.

P.S. More horrifyingly (in an amusing way), there's also

The downside of doing that is that automated code introspection tools
don't know that the methods don't really exist, they just see the
method names in the type dictionary and offer them up for code
completion.

So in this case, the extra runtime check isn't worth the cost of
breaking static code analysis and other forms of introspection.

Cheers,
Nick.

And thank you for getting ordering into csv.DictReader.  That was a significant improvement in usability :-)

It's technically possible for attributes to do something custom when
accessed, without appearing in __dir__. I don't know if that's a useful
technique in this case, but sometimes it is.
