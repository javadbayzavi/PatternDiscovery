Subject: [Python-Dev] Adding NetworkIOError for bug 1706815
Message-ID: <20070704065843.GG5055@electricrain.com>

In response to bug 1706815 and seeing messy code to catch errors in
network apps I've implemented most of the ideas in the bug and added a
NetworkIOError exception (child of IOError).  With this, socket.error
would now inherit from NetworkIOError instead of being its own thing
(the old one didn't even declare a parent!).

Complete patch attached to the bug.  All unit tests pass.
Documentation updates included.

Any thoughts?  I'm happy with it and would like to commit it if folks
agree.

Subject: [Python-Dev] PEP 366 - Relative imports from main modules
Message-ID: <468B97E5.7070800@gmail.com>

A c.l.p discussion referenced from Python-URL just brought this topic 
back to my attention, and with the relatively low traffic on the 
development lists in the last few days, it seemed like a good time to 
repost this PEP (it vanished beneath the Unicode identifier discussion 
last time).

Cheers,

PEP: 366
Title: Main module explicit relative imports

Abstract
========

This PEP proposes a backwards compatible mechanism that permits
the use of explicit relative imports from executable modules within
packages. Such imports currently fail due to an awkward interaction
between PEP 328 and PEP 338 - this behaviour is the subject of at
least one open SF bug report (#1510172)[1], and has most likely
been a factor in at least a few queries on comp.lang.python (such
as Alan Isaac's question in [2]).

With the proposed mechanism, relative imports will work automatically
if the module is executed using the ``-m`` switch. A small amount of
boilerplate will be needed in the module itself to allow the relative
imports to work when the file is executed by name.


Import Statements and the Main Module
=====================================

(This section is taken from the final revision of PEP 338)

The release of 2.5b1 showed a surprising  (although obvious in
retrospect) interaction between PEP 338 and PEP 328 - explicit
relative imports don't work from a main module. This is due to
the fact that relative imports rely on ``__name__`` to determine
the current module's position in the package hierarchy. In a main
module, the value of ``__name__`` is always ``'__main__'``, so
explicit relative imports will always fail (as they only work for
a module inside a package).

Investigation into why implicit relative imports *appear* to work when
a main module is executed directly but fail when executed using ``-m``
showed that such imports are actually always treated as absolute
imports. Because of the way direct execution works, the package
containing the executed module is added to sys.path, so its sibling
modules are actually imported as top level modules. This can easily
lead to multiple copies of the sibling modules in the application if
implicit relative imports are used in modules that may be directly
executed (e.g. test modules or utility scripts).

For the 2.5 release, the recommendation is to always use absolute
imports in any module that is intended to be used as a main module.
The ``-m`` switch already provides a benefit here, as it inserts the
current directory into ``sys.path``, instead of the directory containing
the main module. This means that it is possible to run a module from
inside a package using ``-m`` so long as the current directory contains
the top level directory for the package. Absolute imports will work
correctly even if the package isn't installed anywhere else on
sys.path. If the module is executed directly and uses absolute imports
to retrieve its sibling modules, then the top level package directory
needs to be installed somewhere on sys.path (since the current directory
won't be added automatically).

Here's an example file layout::

     devel/
         pkg/
             __init__.py
             moduleA.py
             moduleB.py
             test/
                 __init__.py
                 test_A.py
                 test_B.py

So long as the current directory is ``devel``, or ``devel`` is already
on ``sys.path`` and the test modules use absolute imports (such as
``import pkg.moduleA`` to retrieve the module under test, PEP 338
allows the tests to be run as::

     python -m pkg.test.test_A
     python -m pkg.test.test_B

Rationale for Change
====================

In rejecting PEP 3122 (which proposed a higher impact solution to this
problem), Guido has indicated that he still isn't particularly keen on
the idea of executing modules inside packages as scripts [2]. Despite
these misgivings he has previously approved the addition of the ``-m``
switch in Python 2.4, and the ``runpy`` module based enhancements
described in PEP 338 for Python 2.5.

The philosophy that motivated those previous additions (i.e. access to
utility or testing scripts without needing to worry about name clashes in
either the OS executable namespace or the top level Python namespace) is
also the motivation behind fixing what I see as a bug in the current
implementation.

This PEP is intended to provide a solution which permits explicit
relative imports from main modules, without incurring any significant
costs during interpreter startup or normal module import.


Proposed Solution
=================

The heart of the proposed solution is a new module attribute
``__package_name__``. This attribute will be defined only in
the main module (i.e. modules where ``__name__ == "__main__"``).

For a directly executed main module, this attribute will be set
to the empty string. For a module executed using
``runpy.run_module()`` with the ``run_name`` parameter set to
``"__main__"``, the attribute will be set to
``mod_name.rpartition('.')[0]`` (i.e., everything up to
but not including the last period).

In the import machinery there is an error handling path which
deals with the case where an explicit relative reference attempts
to go higher than the top level in the package hierarchy. This
error path would be changed to fall back on the ``__package_name__``
attribute for explicit relative imports when the importing module
is called ``"__main__"``.

With this change, explicit relative imports will work automatically
from a script executed with the ``-m`` switch. To allow direct
execution of the module, the following boilerplate would be needed at
the top of the script::

   if __name__ == "__main__" and not __package_name__:
       __package_name__ = "<expected_pkg_name>"

Note that this boilerplate is sufficient only if the top level package
is already accessible via sys.path. Additional code that manipulates
sys.path would be needed in order for direct execution to work
without the top level package already being on sys.path.

This approach also has the same disadvantage as the use of absolute
imports of sibling modules - if the script is moved to a different
package or subpackage, the boilerplate will need to be updated
manually.

With this feature in place, the test scripts in the package above
would be able to change their import lines to something along the
lines of ``import ..moduleA``. The scripts could then be
executed unmodified even if the name of the package was changed.

(Rev 47142 in SVN implemented an early variant of this proposal
which stored the main module's real module name in the
'__module_name__' attribute. It was reverted due to the fact
that 2.5 was already in beta by that time.)


Alternative Proposals
=====================

PEP 3122 proposed addressing this problem by changing the way
the main module is identified. That's a huge compatibility cost
to incur to fix something that is a pretty minor bug in the overall
scheme of things.

The advantage of the proposal in this PEP is that its only impact on
normal code is the tiny amount of time needed at startup to set the extra
attribute in the main module. The changes to the import machinery are all
in an existing error handling path, so normal imports don't incur any
performance penalty at all.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Tracker item: 735515 - urllib to cache 301
	redirections?
Message-ID: <20070704192223.GA3393@gmail.com>

Hi,
One of the tracker items: 735515 mentions that urllib should cache 301 and 302
redirections.

urllib / urllib2 should cache the results of 301
(permanent) redirections. This shouldn't break
anything, since it's just an internal optimisation
from one point of view -- but it's also what the
RFC (2616, section 10.3.2, first para) says
SHOULD happen. 

I am trying to understand, what does it mean.
Should the original url be avaiable to the user upon request as urllib
automatically calls the redirect_request and provides the redirected url only?

I am not completely getting what "cache - redirection" implies and what should
be done with the urllib2 module. Any pointers?

Thanks,

True, that would be simpler; is it enough?  If we avoid adding the new
exception, I really think it should inherit from IOError, not
EnviromnentError because sockets are I/O.  urllib2.URLError was
already a child of IOError; doing the same to to socket.error makes
sense.

The patch makes URLError a child of NetworkIOError instead of IOError.
Does that make sense?  URLs as an abstract concept may or may not
imply network I/O behind the scenes though network i/o is the most
common use.  I could take that argument further and suggest they don't
necessarily even imply actual I/O if you've provided your own protocol
handlers.

The question then becomes if there are any use cases for "except
NetworkIOError:" that code wouldn't want to just use "except IOError:"
for that using "except socket.error:" or "except urllib2.URLError:"
are insufficient for.  My intuition is telling me: probably not.
urllib2 code should catch socket.error everywhere internally and turn
it into a URLError (the code appears to do this in many places though
i haven't audited that it does everywhere).

-greg

PS for the person complaining that the url didn't work.  blame
   sourceforge and go look the bug up by id yourself.  nothing i can
   do about that.

I see no big problems with this, except I wonder if in the end it
wouldn't be better to *always* define __package_name__ instead of only
when it's in main? And then perhaps rename it to __package__? Done
properly it could always be used for relative imports, rather than
parsing __module__ to find the package. Then you won't even need the
error handler.

FWIW, I find the PEP is rather wordy for such a simple proposal (it
took me more time to find the proposal than to understand it :-).

Oh, one more thing. Perhaps we should rename it, like the other PEPs
still active slated for inclusion in Py3k (and backporting to 2.6)?

OTOH, when os.read() returns an error, os.error (OSError) is raised.
Is that not I/O?

IMO this is all hairsplitting, and the exact inheritance hierarchy for
these doesn't matter much -- nobody is going to write a handler that
treats OSError or socket.error different than IOError.

(If you have different call sites that raise different exceptions,
each call site should have a separate try/except rather than a single
try/except with multiple handlers.)

Well, as long as NetworkIOError inherits from IOError, the change is
compatible, but I don't think anyone would care. Making URLError a
child of EnvironmentError or socket.error could be defended too, and I
doubt it makes a difference for any real code. (Anyone with evidence
to the contrary, please speak up now).

Hm. I'm no fan of such renaming of exceptions (even though the
__cause__ mechanism from PEP 3134 (formerly 344) makes it a little
less problematic).

Hi, I am trying to duplicate the indenting functionality of the IDLE into another environment used in an educational setting at MIT.  As Python is open software, I assume I can look at the source code for the IDLE.  If someone could kindly give me a pointer as to where I might find the source code for this functionality, I would very much appreciate it.

Thank you very much,

Might as well be consistent - I'll take care of that when I update the 
PEP based on your suggestions.

I'll have a look at what would be involved in always defining 
__package__ and using it for relative imports. I suspect it will be a 
slightly bigger change than the current PEP (i.e. more lines/files 
touched), but not significantly so.

>> FWIW, I find the PEP is rather wordy for such a simple proposal (it

Yeah, I still haven't come up with a particularly concise way of 
explaining why relative imports don't currently work in main modules.

I'll rearrange the PEP to put the proposed fix before the detailed 
explanation of the problem (in fact, given that the latter is mainly of 
historical interest now, I may just include a pointer to the relevant 
section of PEP 338).

Cheers,
Nick.

+1 for __package__, and putting it everywhere.  Relative import 
should use it first if present, falling back to use of __name__.

The community buildbot had stopped working since the
last reboot, because the crontab line to restart it
at reboot was incorrect; nobody had noticed so far
(i.e. since June 21).

Hi,

I submitted this patch a few days ago, and unfortunately have been
busy to reply, but now it's Friday :).
<snip>

Patches item #1744382, was opened at 2007-06-27 20:08

You can respond by visiting:
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=305470&aid=1744382&group_id=5470

<snip>

The patch is unacceptable in its current form:
- it should be provided as a patch to threading.py, not as a separate
module
- it should have a name that follows "the convention", which seems to be
that
  it should have "reader" and "writer" in its name (or "rw"). See how C#
and
  Java do it (and other libraries you can find that provide such a
mechanism)
- it needs documentation
- it needs tests.

<snip>

I can do the other three parts, but I am wondering, how do I write a
deterministic test unit for my patch?  How is it done with the
threading model in python in general?


Cheers,
Yaakov

   I was wondering if there is a schedule for the
release of a python 2.5.2 update? I don't see anything
like that on the www.python.org web site. Thanks in
advance for any information.

This would solve some issues I'm currently having with relative imports.

I don't know how it is done in general, but for reference, here are  
some of the unittests for my read/write lock class:

Not exactly deterministic.  Instead of a flag attribute, try using an Event or
a Condition.  Either of these will let you know exactly when the necessary
operation has completed.

There is no schedule at the moment, no.  It is up to the release
manager (Anthony Baxter) and python-dev to decide if another release
is necessary soon or not.

Having said that, there will very likely be a 2.5 release shortly
after 2.6 is out the door.

Ah.  Given all that, the point of a NetworkIOError is moot.  I had
assumed read would raise an IOError but hadn't read the code.  Looks
like fileobject.c's file_read() raises IOError as I expected but
posixmodule.c's read() raises OSError (fair enough, its the os module).

Since socket objects are treated like file objects in many cases I
think IOError would be a more appropriate parent than
EnvironmentError.  There was a case at work recently that started me
down the path of looking at this where code caught IOError but not
socket.error.

Any objects to me just having socket.error inherit from IOError?

Subject: [Python-Dev] Python for embedding?
Message-ID: <468F4D2B.8030805@wikstrom.dk>

Python is a great language. We all know. But I have tried implementing 
Python into C/C++ applications, and have a) had a lot of trouble getting 
it running properly and b) it is slow, compared to other languages, like 
LUA.

What is my idea, is to make a Python implementation made to be embedded 
into applications.. It will have these features:
a) Small footprint.
b) Easy-to-use, but still advanced API.
c) Stackless.
d) A smaller standard library.
e) Fast.

The smaller footprint is, so that it will use minimal resources 
possible, leaving more for the underlying application.
The API is the most important thing, really, as this distro will be made 
for embedding. It will not have any compiler features, just an interpreter.
Stackless Python is - as we know - faster than Python. Another good 
reason to use it in embedding.
A lot of the standard library is seldom used; we only need the core 
functions.
Fast, of course! It needs to be the fastest interpreter ever written (at 
least fast).

Hope you have any ideas/comments!

This thread should go into either comp.lang.python or the python-ideas

In PyGObject we want to use a 'message' attribute in an exception defined by
us.  The name 'message' comes from a C API, therefore we would like to keep
it for easier mapping between C and Python APIs.  Why does Python have to
deprecate this attribute?

.../gobject/option.py:187: DeprecationWarning: BaseException.message has
been deprecated as of Python 2.6

It's going away in Python 3.0.  In retrospect the attribute was a
mistake thanks to its odd semantics to be backwards compatible in a
reasonable way.  Plus its removal from the code base was nasty mostly
thanks to C-based exceptions.

You can get around this easily enough with a subclass that uses a
property for message::

  class gerror(Exception):
    def _get_message(self, message): return self._message
    def _set_message(self, message): self._message = message
    message = property(_get_message, _set_message)

It can be deprecated for BaseException without it being deprecated for your 
exception.  You'll need to define a property that overrides the property in 
BaseException; something like this in Python (not tested):

  class MyException(Exception):

      _message = None

      @apply
      def message():

          def get(self):
              return self._message

          def set(self, value):
              self._message = value

          return property(get, set)

I think your use case is entirely reasonable, and can be handled readily.

The bugs.python.org tracker is not yet the official tracker for Python
yet (partially due to the sf.net data dump issue).

PEP: 366
Title: Main module explicit relative imports
Version: $Revision: 56190 $
Last-Modified: $Date: 2007-07-08 17:45:46 +1000 (Sun, 08 Jul 2007) $

Abstract
========

This PEP proposes a backwards compatible mechanism that permits
the use of explicit relative imports from executable modules within
packages. Such imports currently fail due to an awkward interaction
between PEP 328 and PEP 338.

By adding a new module level attribute, this PEP allows relative imports
to work automatically if the module is executed using the ``-m``switch.
A small amount of boilerplate in the module itself will allow the relative
imports to work when the file is executed by name.


Proposed Change
===============

The major proposed change is the introduction of a new module level
attribute, ``__package__``. When it is present, relative imports will
be based on this attribute rather than the module ``__name__``
attribute.

As with the current ``__name__`` attribute, setting ``__package__`` will
be the responsibility of the PEP 302 loader used to import a module.
Loaders which use ``imp.new_module()`` to create the module object will
have the new attribute set automatically to
``__name__.rpartition('.')[0]``.

``runpy.run_module`` will also set the new attribute, basing it off the
``mod_name`` argument, rather than the ``run_name`` argument. This will
allow relative imports to work correctly from main modules executed with
the ``-m`` switch.

When the main module is specified by its filename, then the
``__package__`` attribute will be set to the empty string. To allow
relative imports when the module is executed directly, boilerplate
similar to the following would be needed before the first relative
import statement:

   if __name__ == "__main__" and not __package_name__:
       __package_name__ = "<expected_pacakage_name>"

Note that this boilerplate is sufficient only if the top level package
is already accessible via ``sys.path``. Additional code that manipulates
``sys.path`` would be needed in order for direct execution to work
without the top level package already being importable.

This approach also has the same disadvantage as the use of absolute
imports of sibling modules - if the script is moved to a different
package or subpackage, the boilerplate will need to be updated
manually.


Rationale for Change
====================

The current inability to use explicit relative imports from the main
module is the subject of at least one open SF bug report (#1510172)[1],
and has most likely been a factor in at least a few queries on
comp.lang.python (such as Alan Isaac's question in [2]).

This PEP is intended to provide a solution which permits explicit
relative imports from main modules, without incurring any significant
costs during interpreter startup or normal module import.

The section in PEP 338 on relative imports and the main module provides
further details and background on this problem.


Reference Implementation
========================

Rev 47142 in SVN implemented an early variant of this proposal
which stored the main module's real module name in the
'__module_name__' attribute. It was reverted due to the fact
that 2.5 was already in beta by that time.

A new patch will be developed for 2.6, and forward ported to
Py3k via svnmerge.


Alternative Proposals
=====================

PEP 3122 proposed addressing this problem by changing the way
the main module is identified. That's a significant compatibility cost
to incur to fix something that is a pretty minor bug in the overall
scheme of things, and the PEP was rejected [3].

The advantage of the proposal in this PEP is that its only impact on
normal code is the small amount of time needed to set the extra
attribute when importing a module. Relative imports themselves should
be sped up fractionally, as the package name is stored in the module
globals, rather than having to be worked out again for each relative
import.

Subject: [Python-Dev] itertools addition: getitem()
Message-ID: <4690B08E.3010501@livinglogic.de>

I'd like to propose the following addition to itertools: A function 
itertools.getitem() which is basically equivalent to the following 
python code:

_default = object()

def getitem(iterable, index, default=_default):
    try:
       return list(iterable)[index]
    except IndexError:
       if default is _default:
          raise
       return default

but without materializing the complete list. Negative indexes are 
supported too (this requires additional temporary storage for abs(index) 
objects).

The patch is available at http://bugs.python.org/1749857

Servus,
    Walter

My main question: Who will implement that idea? Ideas are cheap;
making them come true is a lot of work.

It seems that you believe the current implementation of Python
is *deliberately* slow, and that a new implementation would
necessarily be faster. Please rest assured that this is not
the case: people have put a considerable amount of work into
making Python as fast as it is today.

Martin

How important is it to have the default in this API? __getitem__()
doesn't have a default; instead, there's a separate API get() that
provides a default (and I find defaulting to None more manageable than
the "_default = object()" pattern).

getattr() has a default too, while __getattr__ hasn't...

Fair enough.

But I still want to hear of a practical use case for the default here.

Of course it isn't implemented this way in the C version.

In most cases

    foo = getitem(iterable, 0, None)
    if foo is not None:
       ...

is simpler than:

    try:
       foo = getitem(iterable, 0)
    except IndexError:
       pass
    else:
       ...

Here is a use case from one of my "import XML into the database" scripts:

    compid = getitem(root[ns.Company_company_id], 0, None)
    if compid:
       compid = int(compid)

The expression root[ns.company_id] returns an iterator that produces all 
children of the root node that are of the element type company_id. If 
there is a company_id its content will be turned into an int, if not 
None will be used.

Servus,
    Walter

Ahem. I hope you have a better use case for getitem() than that
(regardless of the default issue). I find it clearer to write that as

try:
  compid = root[ns.company_id].next()
except StopIteration:
  compid = None
else:
  compid = int(compid)

While this is more lines, it doesn't require one to know about
getitem() on an iterator. This is the same reason why setdefault() was
a mistake -- it's too obscure to invent a compact spelling for it
since the compact spelling has to be learned or looked up.

Apropos of this discussion, I've occasionally wanted a faster version of the
following:

_nothing=object()

def nth_next(seq,n,default=_nothing):
  '''
  Return the n'th next element for seq, if it exists.

  If default is specified, it is return when the sequence is too short.
  Otherwise StopIteration is raised.
  '''
  try:
    for i in xrange(n-1):
      seq.next()
    return seq.next()
  except StopIteration:
    if default is _nothing:
      raise
    return default

The nice thing about this function is that it solves several problems in
one: extraction of the n'th next element, testing for a minimum sequence
length given a sentinel value, and just skipping n elements.  It also leaves
the sequence in a useful and predictable state, which is not true of the
Python-version getitem code.  While cute, I can't say if it is worthy of
being an itertool function.

Also vaguely apropos:

def ilen(seq):
  'Return the length of the hopefully finite sequence'
  n = 0
  for x in seq:
    n += 1
  return n

Why?  Because I find myself implementing it in virtually every project.
Maybe I'm just an outlier, but many algorithms I implement need to consume
iterators (for side-effects, obviously) and it is sometimes nice to know
exactly how many elements were consumed.

Also known as::

    sum(1 for _ in iterable)

That's always been simple enough that I didn't feel a need for an
ilen() function.

Subject: [Python-Dev] proposed attribute lookup optimization
Message-ID: <200707082023.19837.pogonyshev@gmx.net>

Hi,

I would like to propose an optimization (I think so, anyway) for the
way attributes are looked up.  Currently, it is done like this:

	return value of attribute in instance.__dict__ if present
	for type in instance.__class__.__mro__:
	    return value of attribute in type.__dict__ if present
	raise AttributeError

I propose adding to each type a C-implementation-private dictionary
of attribute-name => type-in-which-defined.  Then, it will not be
necessary to traverse __mro__ on each attribute lookup for names
which are present in this lookup dictionary.

This optimization will not have any effect for attributes defined
on instance.  It will, however, for type attributes, most notably
for methods.  It will most likely cause a slowdown for looking up
attributes that are defined directly on self.__class__, not on any
of its bases.  However, I believe it will be a benefit for all
non-extremely shallow inheritance tree.  Especially if they involve
multiple inheritance.

One open question is what to do in case an attribute on a type is
set or deleted.

Python example:

class Current (type):

    @staticmethod
    def getattribute (self, name):
        dict = object.__getattribute__(self, '__dict__')
        if name in dict:
            return dict[name]

        mro = object.__getattribute__ (self, '__class__').__mro__
        for type in mro:
            dict = type.__dict__
            if name in dict:
                return dict[name]

        raise AttributeError

    def __init__(self, name, bases, dict):
        super (Current, self).__init__(name, bases, dict)
        self.__getattribute__ = Current.getattribute


class Optimized (type):

    @staticmethod
    def getattribute (self, name):
        dict = object.__getattribute__(self, '__dict__')
        if name in dict:
            return dict[name]

        # <possible optimization>
        lookup = object.__getattribute__ (self, '__class__').__lookup_cache__
        if name in lookup:
            return lookup[name].__dict__[name]
        # </possible optimization>

        mro = object.__getattribute__ (self, '__class__').__mro__
        for type in mro:
            dict = object.__getattribute__(type, '__dict__')
            if name in dict:
                return dict[name]

        raise AttributeError

    # <possible optimization>
    def build_lookup_cache (self):
        lookup = {}
        for type in self.__mro__:
            for name in type.__dict__:
                if name not in lookup:
                    lookup[name] = type

        return lookup
    # </possible optimization>

    def __init__(self, name, bases, dict):
        super (Optimized, self).__init__(name, bases, dict)
        # <possible optimization>
        self.__lookup_cache__ = self.build_lookup_cache ()
        # </possible optimization>
        self.__getattribute__ = Optimized.getattribute


class A (object):
    __metaclass__ = Optimized
    x = 1

class B (A):
    pass

class C (B):
    pass

class D (C):
    pass

class E (D):
    pass

t = E ()

for k in xrange (100000):
    t.x

Try swapping metaclass of A from Optimized to Current and measure
execution time.

Actually, it is only done like that for "classic" classes.  New-style 
classes actually work more like this:

     descriptor = None
     for t in type(ob).__mro__:
         if attribute in t.__dict__:
             descriptor = t.__dict__[attribute]
             if hasattr(descriptor, '__set__'):
                 return descriptor.__get__(ob, type(ob))
             break

     if attribute in ob.__dict__: return ob.__dict__[attribute]
     if descriptor is not None: return descriptor.__get__(ob, type(ob))
     if hasattr(type(ob),'__getattr__'): return ob.__getattr__(attribute)
     raise AttributeError

Sounds good to me...  but it's just as simple to store the 
descriptors directly, rather than the type that defines the 
descriptor.  Might as well cut out the middleman.

I believe that someone proposed this already, with a patch, in fact...


>This optimization will not have any effect for attributes defined
>on instance.

It will for new-style classes, actually -- and a significant one if 
the inheritance  hierarchy is deep and doesn't contain a default 
value for the attribute.


>   It will, however, for type attributes, most notably
>for methods.

Yep.  It'll also speed up access to inherited slots.


>   It will most likely cause a slowdown for looking up

Not if it's a direct cache of descriptors; in that case it will have 
no effect on lookup time.


>One open question is what to do in case an attribute on a type is
>set or deleted.

New-style classes can handle this easily; they know their subclasses 
and you can't directly write to a new-style class' __dict__.  So when 
you set or delete an attribute on a type, it's possible to walk the 
subclasses and update their caches accordingly.  I believe Python 
already does this so that if you e.g. set 'sometype.__call__ = 
something', then all the subclasses' C-level tp_call slots get 
changed to match.  The same approach could be used for caching on 
new-style classes.

Again, though, this has already been proposed, and I believe there's 
a patch awaiting review for inclusion in 2.6 (and presumably 3.0).

Yep.  The email is not meant to be useful to python-dev yet.  It's
there as we work out issues and make sure stuff continues to work.

The export issue should hopefully be fixed on Tuesday.  We then need
to change the importer since the DTD changed.  Then we will verify
everything works and do the transition (hopefully soon).

Is this really the best semantics for this?  Let's say I have
A/B/__init__.py and A/B/C.py.  With these semantics I would have A.B
having __package__ be 'A' and A.B.C having 'A.B'.

While I agree that the A.B.C setting is correct, is the A.B value what
is truly desired?  Is an __init__ module really to be considered part
of the above package?  I always viewed the __init__ module as part of
its own package.  Thus I expected A.B to have __package__ set to
'A.B'.

Beyond just what I expected, the reason I bring this up is that if
__package__ had the semantics I am suggesting, it is trivial to
discover what modules are the package __init__ modules (as
``__package__ == __name__``) compared to being a submodule
(``__package__ and __package__ != __name__``).  As of right now you
can only do that if you examine __file__ for __init__.py(c), but that
is highly dependent on how the module was loaded.  It might be nice if
what kind of module (top-level, package, or submodule) something is
based on its metadata.

Yay! I'm sure the tracker change has taken more effort than most people

Well I have used (a Python version of) this getitem() function to 
implement a library that can match a CSS3 expression against an XML 
tree. For implementing the nth-child(), nth-last-child(), nth-of-type() 
and nth-last-of-type() pseudo classes (see 
http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#structural-pseudos) getitem() was 
very useful.

Why not use the existing islice() function?

   x = list(islice(iterable, i, i+1)) or default

Also, as a practical matter, I think it is a bad idea to introduce
__getitem__ style access to itertools because the starting point
moves with each consecutive access:

    # access items 0, 2, 5, 9, 14, 20, ...
    for i in range(10):
        print getitem(iterable, i)

Worse, this behavior changes depending on whether the iterable
is re-iterable (a string would yield consecutive items while a
generator would skip around as shown above).

Besides being a bug factory, I think the getitem proposal would
tend to steer people down the wrong road, away from more
natural solutions to problems involving iterators.  A basic step
in learning the language is to differentiate between sequences
and general iterators -- we should not conflate the two.

This doesn't work, because it produces a list

>>> list(islice(xrange(10), 2, 3)) or 42
[2]

The following would work:
   x = (list(islice(iterable, i, i+1)) or [default])[0]

However islice() doesn't support negative indexes, getitem() does.

islice() has the same "problem":

>>> from itertools import *
>>> iterable = iter(xrange(100))
>>> for i in range(10):
...     print list(islice(iterable, i, i+1))
[0]
[2]
[5]
[9]
[14]
[20]
[27]
[35]
[44]
[54]

>>> iterable = xrange(100)
>>> for i in range(10):
...     print list(islice(iterable, i, i+1))
[0]
[1]
[2]
[3]
[4]
[5]
[6]
[7]
[8]
[9]

I don't think that
   (list(islice(iterable, i, i+1)) or [default])[0]
is more natural than
   getitem(iterable, i, default)

But doesn't the very same argument also apply against islice(), which
you just offered as an alternative?

PS. If Walter is also at EuroPython, maybe you two could discuss this in person?

Good point - PEP 328 makes it explicit that __init__.py is treated like 
any other module in the package for purposes of relative imports, so the 
semantics you suggest are the ones required. I hadn't actually thought 
about this case, as it wasn't relevant when the new attribute applied 
only to the main module.

However, those semantics mean that we won't be able to automatically add 
the new attribute inside imp.new_module(), as that function doesn't know 
whether or not the new module is a package.

This part of the argument isn't relevant though, as it's already trivial 
to determine whether or not a module is a package by checking for a 
__path__ attribute. That's what PEP 302 specifies, and it is how the 
relative import machinery currently determines whether to use __name__ 
or __name__.rpartition('.')[0] as the base for relative imports.

Given the above limitations, I propose that we document the new 
attribute as follows:

"If the module global __package__ exists when executing an import 
statement, it is used to determine the base for relative imports, 
instead of the __name__ and __path__ attributes. This attribute may be 
set by the interpreter before a module is executed - whether or not it 
is set automatically in a given module is implementation dependent."

And for the CPython implementation, I propose that we set the new attribute:
   1. When the main module is executed using the -m switch
   2. When a relative import is executed and the attribute is not yet set

This will allow any module which uses relative imports to benefit from 
the micro-optimisation of caching the package name in normal modules 
(regardless of how the module gets loaded), as well as allowing relative 
imports from the main module (which is the main goal of the PEP).

With the way PEP 302 hands off creation of the module and execution of 
its code to the loader objects, I don't see any way to guarantee that 
__package__ will always be set - this seems like a reasonable compromise.

Cheers,
Nick.

Not really.  The use cases for islice() typically do not involve
repeated slices of an iterator unless it is slicing off the front
few elements on each pass.  In contrast, getitem() is all about
grabbing something other than the frontmost element and seems
to be intended for repeated calls on the same iterator.  And its
support for negative indices seems somewhat weird in the
context of general purpose iterators:  getitem(genprimes(), -1).

I'll study Walter's use case but my instincts say that adding
getitem() will do more harm than good.

That's fine.  __path__ actually isn't used to resolve relative imports
into absolute ones anyway; it's used only as a substitute to sys.path
when importing within a package.

It could be set after the import, but you are right that the loaders
will not necessarily set it before executing code.  You might be able
to use the reload requirement of using an existing dict if the module
is in sys.modules somehow, but that just sounds like asking for
trouble.

That wouldn't make sense as getitem() consumes the iterator! ;)

But seriously: perhaps the name getitem() is misleading? What about 
item() or pickitem()?

This does indeed make as much sense as sum(itertools.count()).

Here's the function in use (somewhat invisibly, as it's used by the 
walknode() method). This gets the oldest news from Python's homepage:

 >>> from ll.xist import parsers, xfind
 >>> from ll.xist.ns import html
 >>> e = parsers.parseURL("http://www.python.org", tidy=True)
 >>> print e.walknode(html.h2 & xfind.hasclass("news"))[-1]
Google Adds Python Support to Google Calendar Developer's Guide


Get the first comment line from a python file:

 >>> getitem((line for line in open("Lib/codecs.py") if 
line.startswith("#")), 0)
'### Registry and builtin stateless codec functions\n'


Create a new unused identifier:

 >>> def candidates(base):
...     yield base
...     for suffix in count(2):
...         yield "%s%d" % (base, suffix)
...
 >>> usedids = set(("foo", "bar"))
 >>> getitem((i for i in candidates("foo") if i not in usedids), 0)
'foo2'

I was referring to the fact that if __path__ is present (indicating a 
package), then the relative import is based directly on __name__, 
otherwise it is based on __name__.rpartition('.')[0].

Cheers,
Nick.

Message-ID: <46934B14.7080802@cenix-bioscience.com>

Hello,

We recently had a production failure caused by the issue fixed in r53624 
on the trunk [1].   I see that this patch has also been applied to 
py3k-struni.  Should this patch be merged to the release branches?  In 
the meantime we will have to patch subprocess.py ourselves.

In theory, I'm in favor of backporting, but how far back do you need/want to
apply it?  There will clearly be more 2.5 releases.  I don't think any more
2.4 releases are planned.

We will only be supporting 2.4 for a few months more, so as far as we 
are concerned a backport to 2.5 would be sufficient.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Need help fixing failing Py3k Unittests in py3k-struni
Message-ID: <ca471dc20707101414q77168e32v12b157c2ab756394@mail.gmail.com>

One of the most daunting tasks remaining for Python 3.0a1 (to be
released by the end of August) is fixing the remaining failing unit
tests in the py3k-struni branch
(http://svn.python.org/view/python/branches/py3k-struni/).

This is the branch where I have started the work on the
string/unification branch. I want to promote this branch to become the
"main" Py3k branch ASAP (by renaming it to py3k), but I don't want to
do that until all unit tests pass. I've been working diligently on
this task, and I've got it down to about 50 tests that are failing on
at least one of OSX and Ubuntu (the platforms to which I have easy
access). Now I need help.

To facilitate distributing the task of getting the remaining tests to
pass, I've created a wiki page:
http://wiki.python.org/moin/Py3kStrUniTests . Please help! It's easy
to help: (1) check out the py3k-struni branch; (2) build it; (3) pick
a test and figure out why it's failing; (4) produce a fix; (5) submit
the fix to SF (or check it in, if you have submit privileges and are
confident enough).

In order to avoid duplicate work, I've come up with a simple protocol:
you mark a test in the wiki as "MINE" (with your name) when you start
looking at it. You mark it as "FIXED [IN SF]" once you fix it, adding
the patch# if the fix is in SF. If you give up, remove your lock,
adding instead a note with what you've found (even just the names of
the failing subtests is helpful).

Please help!

There are other tasks, see PEP 3100. Mail me if you're interested in
anything specifically. (Please don't ask me "do you think I could do
this" -- you know better than I whether you're capable of coding at a
specific level. If you don't understand the task, you're probably not
qualified.)

I've made a meta patch that makes debugging the bugs a lot easier. It
replaces assert_(foo == bar) and failUnless(foo == bar) with
failUnlessEqual(foo, bar). failUnlessEqual shows the value of foo and
bar when they are not equal.

http://www.python.org/sf/1751515

sed -r "s/self\.assert_\((.*)\ ==/self.failUnlessEqual\(\1,/" -i *.py
sed -r "s/self\.failUnless\((.*)\ ==/self.failUnlessEqual\(\1,/" -i *.py

By the way the ctypes unit tests are causing a segfault on my machine:
test_ctypes
Warning: could not import ctypes.test.test_numbers: unpack requires a
string argument of length 1
Segmentation fault

Some of these look questionable, e.g.:

-        self.assert_(d == self.spamle or d == self.spambe)
+        self.failUnlessEqual(d == self.spamle or d, self.spambe)
...
-        self.assert_((a == 42) is False)
+        self.failUnlessEqual((a, 42) is False)

I'd probably go with something a little more restrictive, maybe:

    r'self.assert_\(\S+ == \S+\)'

Something like that ought to have fewer false positives.

You keep posting examples where you call your getitem() function with "0" as 
index, or -1.

getitem(it, 0) already exists and it's spelled it.next(). getitem(it, -1) 
might be useful in fact, and it might be spelled last(it) (or it.last()). Then 
one may want to add first() for simmetry, but that's it:

first(i for i in candidates("foo") if i not in usedids)
last(line for line in open("Lib/codecs.py") if line[0] == '#')

Are there real-world use cases for getitem(it, n) with n not in (0, -1)? I 
share Raymond's feelings on this. And by the way, if you wonder, I have these 
exact feelings as well for islice... :)

Woops! You are right. Even your pattern has caused some false positives
but I've reread the patch and removed the offending lines. I'm going to
upload another patch as soon as I have verified mine again.

Please use self.assertEqual() instead of self.failUnlessEqual() -- the
assertEqual() form is much more common. Otherwise, good idea!

It useful for screen scraping HTML. Suppose you have the following HTML 
table:

<table>
<tr><td>01.01.2007</td><td>12.34</td><td>Foo</td></tr>
<tr><td>13.01.2007</td><td>23.45</td><td>Bar</td></tr>
<tr><td>04.02.2007</td><td>45.56</td><td>Baz</td></tr>
<tr><td>27.02.2007</td><td>56.78</td><td>Spam</td></tr>
<tr><td>17.03.2007</td><td>67.89</td><td>Eggs</td></tr>
<tr><td>          </td><td>164.51</td><td>Total</td></tr>
<tr><td>          </td><td>(incl. VAT)</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

To extract the total sum, you want the second column from the second to 
last row, i.e. something like:
    row = getitem((r for r in table if r.name == "tr"), -2)
    col = getitem((c for c in row if c.name == "td"), 1)

I can reproduce this.  ctypes.test.test_numbers is easy to fix, but there
are other severe problems with ctypes.

I would love to look into these, but I prefer debugging on Windows.
However, the windows build does not work because the _fileio builtin
module is missing from config.c.  Again, this is not so easy to fix,
because the ftruncate function does not exist on Windows.

I don't have a Windows box; contributions to fix this situation are welcome.

Oh, and for the record, it also fails when there are no whitespace issues to
fix. I can't check in my (admittedly somewhat big) svnmerge now. It touches
about 1130 files.

Fixed. The problem was that checkwhitespace.py wasn't closing the SVN
streams it was reading. Added the 'svn_stream_close' call and my checkin got
through. Should be safe to do massive checkins from now on ;-)

	loading disabled
Message-ID: <200707111312.49908.alex.neundorf@kitware.com>

Hi,

this is my first email to this list, I'm currently porting python to some 
platforms with limited capabilities and so I thought it would be a good idea 
to subscribe here.
While doing the porting, I found two small problems in Python 2.5.1:

If Py_USING_UNICODE is disabled, in Python/ast.c decode_unicode() still calls 
unicode-related functions, which leads to undefined references when linking.

If HAVE_DYNAMIC_LOADING is disabled, in Python/import.c 
_PyImport_DynLoadFiletab is still initialized, which also leads to undefined 
references when linking, since then no source file which defines this 
variable is used.

A patch against 2.5.1 is attached.

Best regards
Alex

I have a very remedial question about how to fix test failures due to  
the side effects of string-unicode integration.

The xmlrpc library uses explicit encoding to encode XML tag payloads  
to (almost always) utf8.  Tag literals are not encoded.

What would be the best way to mimic this behavior under the new  
regime?  Just use unicode everywhere and encode the entire XML body  
to utf-8 at the end?  Or deal explicitly in bytes everywhere?  Or..?

Remedially,

- C

OK, good to know.  Of course it is better if done by someone familiar
with Python internals :)  After proposing this I decided it wasn't
worthwile, since it would require cache revalidation after any
assignment to a new class attribute.  But supposedly I just have
incorrect picture of what is often in Python :)

Thanks for fixing it. Those of you having access to dinsdale, feel free
to temporarily disable this particular hook in the future if you find it
is in your way; don't forgot to report the problem at least, and try
enabling it after the questionable checkin has completed.

The correct approach would be to use Unicode (i.e., str) everywhere
and encode to UTF-8 at the end. If that's too hard something's wrong
with the philosophy of using Unicode everywhere...

Subject: [Python-Dev] Subprocesses and SIGPIPE
Message-ID: <f73oji$juu$1@sea.gmane.org>

The documentation for the subprocess module says that it can be used as a
replacement for shell pipelines, and gives an example.

On *nix systems, cpython is set to ignore SIGPIPE, and this setting is
inherited by child processes created by the subprocess module. This is nearly
always not what you want when you're constructing a pipeline.

In practice, I think most programs are not particularly designed (or tested)
to run with SIGPIPE ignored, and I've had trouble caused by this a couple of
times now.

If you know about this, it's easy enough to avoid trouble using something like
this as a preexec_fn for subprocess.Popen:

def permit_sigpipe():
    signal.signal(signal.SIGPIPE, signal.SIG_DFL)

My question is: should subprocess.Popen do this by default? In any case, it
would be good to see this issue mentioned near the pipeline example.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Add a -z interpreter flag to execute a zip file
Message-ID: <596909b30707111943s6a91479cq8cafaebefc34d649@mail.gmail.com>

(resending this now that I'm subscribed, not sure it made it through
the moderation the first time)

I'd like to request comments on this patch I submitted:

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1739468&group_id=5470&atid=305470

There are many details given in the comments on that page.

This can be used to deploy Python programs in a very lightweight and
cross-platform way.  You could imagine a cgi script or a light web app
server being deployed like this.  I have personally deployed Python
programs using zip files and this would get rid of the need for
boilerplate needed for each platform.

The good thing about this is that it's extremely simple -- basically
20 lines of C code to add a -z flag that calls a 3-line Python
function in the runpy module.

I don't believe it overlaps with anything that already exists.  py2exe
and py2app are platform specific and bundle the Python interpreter.
This will be a cross platform binary that doesn't bundle the Python
interpreter.  It doesn't require eggs but I think it would work fine
with eggs, and could help fix a little bug as I mentioned on the patch
page.

Nick Coghlan has reviewed the patch and seems to think it's a good
idea.  Thomas Wouters also said he likes it, and I ran it by Guido
earlier and he seemed to think the idea is good, although I don't
think he has seen the implementation.

thanks,
Andy

See my comment: I must be missing the point of the patch, since
I can do the same thing (make a single executable zip file on
Linux) through a /bin/sh header just fine.

Right, but it's supposed to be cross platform, as mentioned in the
patch.  This will work on Windows.  The main problem I see is that a
shell script in front of a zip file seems like a relatively common
idiom that people use and have different variants on, each of which
have their own idiosyncrasies.  So it would nice to consolidate them
and make it standard and robust.

For example, it looks like eggs have an executable format that is
similar to this.  And see the bug I mentioned where those executable
eggs can't be invoked through a symlink (which to me is a relatively
severe problem).  I think this has to do with some introspection on
$0, but you won't run into that with this implementation.

Also, I mentioned the program called autopar we use at Google that
does the same thing, and it also have a significant number of weird
hacks in the shell header.  I think Thomas Wouters has also worked on
another program to make an executable zip file.

Another example is that the behavior of the zip in your example
depends on what else is in the current directory [1], which isn't
desirable.  Nick pointed out this issue and I addressed it in the
patch by removing "" from sys.path, since the -c flag adds that.  If
lots of people reinvent this wheel (and they have), there are going to
be other subtleties like this that will be missed.

The -z flag also eliminates starting an extra process -- you invoke
the Python interpreter directly instead of starting a shell which in
turn invokes the Python interpreter.

As mentioned, it's also a very tiny amount of code, and I don't see
much potential for bad interactions with other things, the way I've
written it.

But in the description, you said that you do the same on Windows
by making a file that is both a zip file and a batch file. So my
approach is also cross-platform, no?

How do you get the -z option to work on Windows? What extension
do you use, and how is the zipfile created?

Couldn't that also be achieved by documenting best practice in
the documentation? Why is the shell script not robust?

Why that? Why do eggs fail to process $0 correctly, whereas the
-z option gets it correct? That just sounds like a bug in eggs
to me, that could be fixed - or, if not, I'd expect that -z
cannot fix it, either.

My understanding of this note is that
pkg_resources uses sys.argv[0] to determine the version number
of the egg; IIUC, -z won't help at all here because sys.argv[0]
will still be the name of the symlink.

What are those weird hacks, why are they necessary, and how does the
-z option overcome the need for these hacks?

That people fail to make it work with /bin/sh doesn't automatically
mean they succeed with -z. Either they are too unexperienced to
make the shell header correct (in which case documenting best
practice would help), or they have deeper problems with that approach,
in which case it isn't at all obvious that the proposed change
improves anything.

"" should not be removed from sys.path. It is *not* meant to be
the current directory, but the directory where the main script
lives.

See my script. It does not start (fork) another process. Instead,
the existing process gets reused. It execs another program, true.

It's baggage that is rarely needed, and the feature can be readily
implemented in a different way for people who need it.

The approach is cross-platform, in that you can use the approach on
different platforms. The result of the approach, however, is not
cross-platform. You can't distribute your single zip-as-executable to both
Windows and bourne-shell-using platforms. The -z argument does allow that.

Why is the shell script not robust?


There are a lot of subtleties in figuring out which python to execute,
environment variables that you may or may not want to tweak (admittedly
Google's solution that Andy referenced is more vulnerable to that, but it's
not unique to Google by any means.) If you want any kind of flexibility in
the packaged-up program, you need a bunch of logic in the shell script, and
environment-tricks to pass information to the python process, start the
python process and provide a bunch more logic in Python to boot. For
instance, you need to set PYTHONPATH to include the zipfile before you can
import from it, but you don't want that PYTHONPATH to be passed to
subprocesses by accident.

The -z argument makes it extremely simple: the user decides which python to
run, and the program is run directly just like it would if it was unpacked
and run that way.  It makes it extremely easy to create 'single executables'
out of multiple Python files, in the form that single .py files already are.
It leaves building a more complex system (such as eggs) ontop of it entirely
open. The change is a good thing, IMHO. And I say this not because we use a
similar solution at Google -- we already solved it, and we won't be using
the -z argument anytime soon anyway. I say this because I've had many
requests from non-googlers for something exactly like this :)

"" should not be removed from sys.path. It is *not* meant to be
> the current directory, but the directory where the main script

Yes. "" should either be interpreted as the zipfile, or be replaced by the
zipfile. In the case of executing the zipfile, the main script lives *in the
zipfile*.

It's baggage that is rarely needed, and the feature can be readily
> implemented in a different way for people who need it.


I disagree with both statements. The bagage is much less than zipimport
itself, which has proven to be quite useful. Nevertheless, zipimport built
into the interpreter was by no means necessary; current users of it could
have readily implemented it themselves, with no changes to Python. (In fact,
Google's 'autopar' tool does exactly that to support Python 2.2, which lacks
zipimport.) This is a very small, logical and useful extension to zipimport,
and I believe you will find more uses for it than you expect (although I do
believe you yourself don't have a need for it. I just don't think you're a
typical Python programmer in this case :)

I'm in general in favor of this. I will accept it once there is a
working implementation that is satisfactory.

Are we planning on supporting this in 2.6? It might break some 2.5
code that messes with modules and packages?

I wonder, is it even necessary to say anything, after:
>+1.

?

But, since I so often object to new features, and there is a heavy 
Google bias in the existing survey sample, I would like to say that I 
had a problem several months ago in a _radically_ different environment 
(Twisted running on an embedded system, Zipfile of PYCs used to shave 
off as much disk space and startup time as possible) where having the 
subtleties of a "-z" flag figured out already would have saved me a 
_ton_ of work.  I was already aware of the shell-header trick, but 
discovering all the environment-setup details was tedious and 
distracting enough to make me give up and switch to writing a bunch of 
hard-to-test /bin/sh code.

It wasn't a bad project by any means, and Python worked out even better 
than expected (we weren't even sure if it would be able to load into the 
memory available, but it turns out that being able to do everything in a 
single process helped a lot) but a -z option would have been that much 
more impressive :).

In fact, I distinctly remember thinking "You know, if Python had an 
equivalent to Java's '-jar' option, this would be a whole lot easier."

(Even better, on this _particular_ project, would have been a generic 
"run this thing-which-looks-like-a-sys.path-entry" standard format, 
which could have been switched for different deployments to a directory, 
a zipfile, or the result of freezing.  Perhaps that's starting to get 
too obscure, though.)

I'm also +1 on this, for exactly the same reason - I've often thought
that an equivalent of -jar would be useful, but whenever I've had a go
at implementing it myself, the fiddly bits needed have meant that it
ended up not being cost effective to bother...

Getting the details of such a batch file header right on Windows is
not easy, not least because there is no "exec" equivalent on Windows.
The following works, but (a) uses 2 processes, and (b) doesn't
preserve the exit code. The first issue is minor, but the second is a
big problem (and one I don't know how to fix).

Also, on Windows, zip-packaged GUI programs could be useful - these
would be executed using "pythonw -z"

> How do you get the -z option to work on Windows? What extension
> do you use, and how is the zipfile created?

The patch suggests using .pyz and adding a default association to the
installer (much like .py and .pyw have). It also offers a script for
building the zipfiles - either as sample code, or to be included with
Python (it's not clear to me).

It's arguable that .pyz files should use pythonw -z, not python -z, as
file extensions are more often useful for clickable programs in the
GUI. You could have two extensions (.pyz and .pzw, maybe) but I'm not
sure it's worth it.

The point here is that the fiddly part (setting sys.path, locating the
main module, etc) is covered by the -z option, deployment
considerations are easier to handle (and hence the exact defaults
supplied are less crucial) once -z is available.

Right; it should be replaced with the zipfile path instead.

I would personally rather see this option defined as simply placing a 
directory at the front of sys.path, and perhaps defining a default -m 
value of __main__, unless overrridden.  Being able to use the option 
more than once would be nice, too.  On Windows, you can't set an 
environment variable on the same line as a command, so this would 
give you a one-liner way of setting sys.path and running an application.

I do not see a reason to make this option zipfile-specific in any 
way, though; it's just as useful (and sometimes more so) to be able 
to distribute an application as a directory, since that lets you use 
.pyd, .so, .dll etc. without needing the egg cache system for using those.

That's correct; it will not help.  A change in the zipped .egg format 
is required, but could be done.  If the option is added (again, 
without being zipfile-specific!) then there is a reason for me to 
make the change.

Nick suggested using .pyz, and others seem to like that solution
(possibly using pythonw) and that seems logical enough to me.  If it's
agreed that that's the right solution on Windows, I can put in the
work for that.

I think it's pretty clear that it's not robust, and there have been
even more anecdotal examples on this thread.  Everyone does it
slightly differently -- not for any particular reason, but just
because the right thing isn't trivial.

As I pointed out, the example you came up with (which many others
would come up with too) has a fairly serious problem, in that it will
import things from outside the .zip file.  I could build my .zip file
on my system, test it out, and then deploy it to another machine and
it will break.  Ironically, this happened to *me* while developing the
patch!

OK, I could be mistaken here, I haven't actually repro'd this bug.

I don't think this is true at all.  I have provided the sample code to
make one of these files, and so you basically have to run a command
line, rather than write a shell header -- and the shell header is
currently not documented anywhere.  As mentioned, this approach also
prevents you from having to start the shell, and makes it more
portable, since people might use #!/bin/myfavoriteshell or use
#!/bin/sh and not realize they are using system-specific features of
the shell.

Regardless of what "" *should* be interpretreted as, the example you
gave has the problem mentioned (with current versions of Python) --
that "" *is* the current directory and thus things get imported
outside of the zip file when they are not found in the zip file.

Right now "" is replaced with the zip file.  If there's a better
implementation I'm willing to change it.

I also disagree with both statements. : )  I think others have said
basically the exact same thing as I am saying: that it is *commonly*
needed, it's not a lot of baggage in Python since it's so little code,
and it's easy to get wrong.

That's indeed what the current implementation does, replacing "" with
the zip file.

Actually, that's a good idea, and it does work with my current
implementation [1], although we'd have to change the name __zipmain__.
 Is __main__ a good idea considering that is used for something
similar but implemented completely differently (the module name)?  I
thought about using __main__, but decided on __zipmain__ since seemed
to be more explicit and reduce potential conflicts.

To be clear to other readers, the convention would be that if a
__main__.py file exists at the root of a directory, then the whole
directory is considered an executable python program.

Yes, the dynamic library importing is nice.

I've thought about this a little further since my last comment on SF, 
and I think it may be a better idea to handle this as a runpy module 
parameter rather than as a parameter for the main interpreter.

For those that aren't aware, the two commands:

   python -m <module>
   python -m runpy <module>

actually have the same effect - both run the specified module. The 
second version is just a little indirect, as it first executes the runpy 
module, which then makes its a second call to run_module(). It was done 
this way so that -m style functionality was readily available for Python 
versions prior to 2.4.

The current version of runpy doesn't accept any options, but it would be 
pretty easy to make the following changes:

1. Accept a -p option that prepends path entries. These path entries 
would be combined into a single list from left to right on the command 
line, then the whole list prepended to sys.path. If at least one -p 
option is given, the default '' entry would be removed from sys.path 
(the current directory could be added back in explicitly via -p '.').

2. Attempt to run the module __main__ if no module is otherwise specified

Startup would be fractionally slower than it would be with the C-level 
option, but the code would be much simpler, and the new feature would be 
readily available on any Python implementation which can execute the 
runpy module.

The relevant shebang line to be prepended to a zip file would then look 
something like:

#!/usr/bin/env python -m runpy -p

Cheers,
Nick.

Not just this survey...

There are many python developers at Google and that is not likely to
change anytime soon.  This means that it's even more important to hear
differing points of view.  We need to hear more from people outside of
Google to ensure we are doing the best possible job.  It would also be
great to have more active committers that don't work at Google.

I don't have any particular objection to using runpy for this, but I 
believe that this shebang line won't actually work on certain non-BSD 
OSes, such as most Linux versions, which allow you to have at most 
*one* argument to a #! line, and will combine anything after the 
executable portion into a single argument.  This means that the only 
workable form of this line for cross-platform use is:

#!/usr/bin/python2.6 -z

And of course that won't work if Python is somewhere else.  You can't 
both use env to invoke Python, *and* expect arguments to work.  env 
will receive a single argument of "python -m runpy -p", which it will 
then try to invoke.  On Mac OS and various other BSDs, your example 
will work correctly, but it won't work most anywhere else, as few 
OSes actually support passing individual arguments from a #! line.  See:

    http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/

That would be why it *is* a good idea; it's the One Obvious Way To Do It.  :)

Now we just need an option abbreviation that's less obscure than 
'-z', given that this isn't just for zipfiles.  Either that, or we 
can pretend it stands for "zoom in on this path and run its __main__".  ;-)

Hi,

There seems to be a typo in the doc of itertools.dropwhile() :

Make an iterator that drops elements from the iterable as long as the
predicate is true; afterwards, returns every element. Note, the iterator
does not produce *any* output until the predicate is true, so it may have a
lengthy start-up time.

It says something and then the opposite, so which one is true ?

I still don't understand how so. How will this work on Windows?

That's why I say a best-practice solution should be established.
In this case, if the actual main function is invoked through
-c, the -c script could get a sys.path.append statement as
well.

Really? I think there a still a number of subtleties, like what
sys.argv[0] will be, and how sys.path will look like. It's definitely
*not* the same as if you unzipped it, and ran the unzipped one.

Ok. I'll shut up, just hoping that this won't cause too much trouble
in the long run.

Ok. It would be good if the patch actually added that extension, rather

I might be confusing things, but I think some systems only allow a
single argument in the shebang line.

You mean using svnmerge?  If so, see the dev FAQ:
http://www.python.org/dev/faq/#how-do-i-merge-branches .  If you are
after something else then I don't know.  =)

I do know, though, that Thomas kept talking about moving us over to
Bazaar (or some distributed VCS) and instead of having a ton of svn
branches we have distributed VCS branch for each feature in Py3K.
That way the VCS's strong merge system would work in our favour for
pulling in from the various Py3K branches and for eventual mainline
merging.

So does everyone agree that there should be a new extension called
.pyz?  And that the definition of this is a .zip file with a
__zipmain__.py module at its root?  If so, I can make the change... I
haven't looked around the codebase yet but it sounds easy enough.

This makes it seem like a bigger change than it is, but I think it's
the right thing to do to support Windows properly.

Other points:

* I think it's true that the shebang line should only have one argument.

* Does anyone else want to change the -z flag to make more sense for
directories (and possibly change __zipmain__.py to __main__.py)?  In
thinking about this again, I am not sure I can come up with a real use
case.  I think it's sufficient to treat it as a documented "trick"
that you can substitute a whole directory for a zip file with the -z
flag.  If there is a concrete suggestion, I'd like to discuss it, but
otherwise it seems like we'll get bogged down in expanding use cases.

* Magically looking at the first argument to see if it's a zip file
seems problematic to me.  I'd rather be explicit with the -z flag.
Likewise, I'd rather be explicit and call it __zipmain__ rather than
__main__.

thanks,
Andy

It's always been my impression that all Unix or Linux systems have that

Let's use __main__, please.  Fewer names to remember, and __main__ is 
supposed to be the __name__ of the main program.  It Just Makes Sense<TM>.

Testing your package before you zip it, would be one.  :)  My 
personal main interest was in being able to add an item to sys.path 
without having to set $PYTHONPATH on Windows.  That's why I'd like it 
to be possible to use -z more than once (or whatever the option ends up as).

Eh? First you say there aren't any use cases, now you say there'll be 
too many?  I'm confused.  The only competing proposal besides what 
I've suggested was the one to add an option to "runpy", and IMO 
that's dead in the water due to shebang argument limits.

I personally don't see any benefit to making up an extra name, when 
we already have one that describes the functionality 
perfectly.  There is absolutely nothing about -z that needs or should 
care about zipfile-ness, so why add an unnecessary limitation while 
creating yet another __special__ name to remember?

Via the .pyz extension on Windows, and a shebang header everywhere 
else... although the path and possibly Python version will have to be 
hardcoded in the shebang line.

IMO, sys.argv[0] should equal the -z argument, as should the "script 
directory" entry on sys.path.

Actually, the more I think about this, the more I'm leaning towards 
getting rid of the option and just having the startup code check 
whether sys.argv[0] can be mapped to an importer object, and if so, 
importing __main__ from it.  A special "python script file" importer 
type could be implemented for file objects, so that importing 
__main__ from it will execute the contents of the file in a __main__ module.

This approach would provide uniform argv[0] handling (in that "python 
argv[0]" will always rerun the same program) and allow zipfile 
shebangs to use 'env' to invoke Python, since no command-line option 
is then required.

There is one slight complication: the "python script file" importer 
must adjust sys.path[0] to the directory of the script, instead of 
the script itself.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Registry keys written by x64 installer
Message-ID: <06b801c7c4e9$a5c6c600$090a0a0a@enfoldsystems.local>

After installing the x64 version of Python 2.5.1 via the MSI file on
python.org, I noticed most of the registry keys are "missing".  Further
investigation shows they aren't actually missing, but have simply been
"virtualized", so they actually appear under the Wow6432Node key.

This Wow6432Node key is used by 32bit programs running on a 64bit OS.
Ironically, this means that a 32 bit Python can open HKLM\Software\Python -
the OS virtualizes that request to the Wow3264Node tree.  However, a 64 bit
Python (ie, the very Python that was installed by the MSI) fails to open
that key - no vistualization occurs and as the key specified does not exist,
we fail.  For example:

This is the Python 2.5 installed by the MSI installer:

Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Apr 18 2007, 09:02:36) [MSC v.1400 64 bit (AMD64)]
on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import _winreg
>>> _winreg.OpenKey(_winreg.HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE,
"Software\\Python\\PythonCore")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
WindowsError: [Error 2] The system cannot find the file specified
>>>

But if I use a 32bit version of Python:

Python 2.5.1 (release25-maint, Jun  4 2007, 23:00:11) [MSC v.1310 32 bit
(Intel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import _winreg
>>> _winreg.OpenKey(_winreg.HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE,
"Software\\Python\\PythonCore")
<PyHKEY at 004790B0 (00000098)>

It works.

I'm afraid my knowledge of MSI is very limited, so I'm not sure where to
start.  One thing I did notice is that msilib\__init__.py has a variable
'Win64' set, hard-coded to 0 - but I've no idea if it is relevant.
Presumably it is relevant to *something*, otherwise it would not have been
created - but its unclear when and how this should be set to 1, and if this
should concern people trying to use bdist_msi to create x64 extension
packages - but for now, let's just stick with the topic at hand - the
registry keys set by the installer.

Any clues?

Thanks,

Mark

Per the requirements documented at
http://msdn2.microsoft.com/En-US/library/aa372396.aspx, the behavior
you describe is expected for a 32-bit installer. (To install files and
registry to 64-bit locations, the Template Summary must include
Intel64 or x64 depending on which architecture, and the component must
be marked as 64-bit).

I'm not familiar with how msilib is invoked to create the MSI files in
question, but it does look like setting Win64 to 1 at an early enough
time would cause an Intel64 installer to be built, along with entirely
64-bit components. This wouldn't work for x64 machines, and all
components being 64-bit may be incorrect: potentially the 64-bit
installer should have some 32-bit components.

I'm not a Windows user, so don't have a good feel for the state of the 
extension mess on that platform these days.  PYZ isn't listed on filext.com, 
but I don't know if that means much.

Indeed.  Let's not do something so specific it's a pain to use.

Yes.  A use case for using directories, or for *not* supporting them?  These 
cases should be as similar as possible; like Phillip suggested, we should be 
thinking "sys.path entry" rather than "zip file".

What happens if multiple entries contain __main__.py entries?  I don't like 
this one so much.  I don't know what Java does if you specify -jar more than 
once; that might suggest something.

Identifying ZIP files is straightforward; there's nothing weird about this 
one.

Hi all,

While I'm generally just a silent listener to this list, I thought I'd
share my experiences with distributed SCM - primarily because I think
it's a great step in the right direction.

So far I've used DARCS, Hg, and Git.  And at this point Git is far and
away the winner.

While I can't claim to have spent alot of time with DARCS, my
experience was that it took a fair whack of unintuitive pain to work
out how to extract a patch that I could send upstream to be submitted
to a project.  I believe it also has a reputation for being rather
slow.  I've also noticed that repositories sometimes become "broken"
and need to be re-checked out - but that I'm willing to put down to
some other factor I'm not aware of.

With Hg I went in fast and hard, and nearly got burned before I could
bail out in time :-)  It's very friendly to use, but we run a number
of OpenBSD hosts for our core architecture, and it turns out Hg wraps
calls to patch, and parses the text output from the call (assuming the
version of patch is GnuPatch).  The problem here is that under OpenBSD
the output assumptions get violated, as reflected by the failure of
lots of tests - including repository sanity checks.  That meant Hg
just wasn't going to be an option for us.  I also found that having a
new directory tree of files for each branch was rather onerous.

Having bailed on Hg I found git to be fast, cross platform, and
user-friendly (provided you understand the basic concepts of
distributed SCM, and you're using git 1.5+ ;-) ).  It also has some
really cool features like "rebasing" for letting your branch actively
track the trunk from which you branched it.

I can't speak to how easily any of these cross over to the windows
platform, although none of them seem to be overly windows friendly
(YMMV).  But I presume this would be one of the key problems facing a
distributed versioning system by the python community.

Cheers
Dave

I can definitely see why it "just makes sense", and my first thought
was indeed to name it __main__.  But then you lose the ability to make
a distinction:  What does "if __name__ == '__main__" mean in
__main__.py?  : )  If someone tries does import __main__ from another
module in the program, won't that result in an infinite loop?

There aren't any restrictions on what can be in __main__ (it's just
another module), and while I think it would be a bad practice to
import __main__, I could see people being tripped up by this in
practice.  People might start storing silly things like the program
version there, for convenience.

At Google some people do "import sitecustomize" and get values that
were computed earlier by the sitecustomize.  I could see the same kind
of thing happen with __main__.py.

Where would you do that?  Just typing it literally on the command
line?  Just curious, I have never felt a need to do that.  I use
Python on Windows frequently.

As implemented the patch is fairly simple, and shouldn't have any
unintended consequences.  I'm not necessarily opposed to making it
more general and thinking about sys.path vs. a zip file specifically.
But I don't have a clear enough picture from all the comments of what
exactly to implement.

-z is not the same as "prepend an item to sys.path", because we
replace "" with the -z argument.  And we also munge sys.argv[0] (which
is what you said should happen).

So it's not clear to me at all what multiple -z's should do, exactly.
Can you write out the pseudo code?  Or modify my patch.

I think it would be fine to have both a -z and -p flag, if the
functionality is needed.  -z accepts a zip file or a directory and
does the right thing to run it as an executable.  -p could accept
multiple arguments and literally prepends them to sys.path.  These
seem like different things to me.

I'll look at adding the file association for .pyz (is there an expert
on that for questions?), and in that time hopefully the list can
decide on the rest of the issues.  Or we can just make Guido decide,
which is fine by me. : )

Why wouldn't it work for x64 machines?  Is it simply because msilib only
handles Intel64 when that flag is set?

What 32bit components should a 64bit build of Python include?  Perhaps you
mean *could* - but IIUC, there is no intention to release 32bit and 64bit
versions of Python in a single package (and further, IIUC, no intent on
supporting a 32bit and 64bit installation on the same machine, regardless of
packaging)

I'm afraid its not clear to me if you are agreeing with me (ie, that the

Another issue I see is that -m and -c have command line parsing
semantics, and -z follows those now.

python -z foo.zip -z bar

As implemented, this would pass sys.argv[0:3] == ['foo.zip', '-z', 'bar']

If you allow multiple -z flags to be meaningful, this gets confusing.
The foo.zip program could have a legitimate -z flag.

If you overload -z to mean "prepend things to sys.path", then you
might also want to do python -z /dir1 -z /foo.zip -c 'import foo;
print foo'.  Should this execute dir1/__main__.py, foo.zip/__main__.py
or print foo?

I could be missing what you intend.  But I think the patch as
implemented doesn't have any of these potentially unconsidered cases
and unintended consequences.

It is correct as written.  Given a sequence where predicate is true 1000 times and then alternately false and true, it returns the 
part that is alternately false and true.  So, it did DROP (omit, not return, skip-over, etc) the first 1000 true items and it did 
return EVERY element from the first false to the end.  It did not produce any output for the first 1000 inputs so it took a while to 
get to the first output (the first false).  Hope that clears it up for you.

Right - it sets the template summary to include Intel64, not x64.
Furthermore only one architecture may be set in the template summary,
so an installer may be only one of i386, x64, and Intel64 (although
the latter are assumed to also be able to run i386 binaries).

Agreed. I was just making clear that I'm not familiar with what the
MSI includes, and whether any of the components in a 64-bit install
should be 32-bit or not. With the msilib code as is, it appears to be
all or nothing, or rely on tweaking a global between calls to
start_component.

The former, with hints of caution: it appears the unused 64-bit code
paths of msilib were created to best serve under incorrect
assumptions. With what the code would create (with or without Win64
set), it will not generate the 64-bit registry keys that the 64-bit
program will access. With Win64 set it will not even install except on
an Itanium system. If you just want to get to the keys it currently
sets, there should be an override parameter that causes the registry
API to read the 32-bit keys even in a 64-bit process, but I'm not
familiar with using _winreg.

If there's interest and I can get pointers to where the MSI files are
built, I can look into patching it. I don't have a convenient 64-bit
Windows machine around to test any changes, though.

Hi,

Thanks for the answer.
I agree with you, but this explains the first sentence. The second says that
nothing is output until the predicate is true. It should say" while the
predicate is true" or "until the predicate is false". But I could be
misunderstand 'until' as well (English is not my mother tongue, but
still...)

This doesn't seem to be a common issue with Darcs, but obviously your

Both of these are acknowledged by the core Darcs developers.  Recently
several users posted their regrets to the Darcs mailing lists, and the
developers only said something like "we're working on it, so please
come back and check."  IMO Darcs is a non-starter for a large project
at this point.

Unfortunately, rebasing doesn't seem to be stable yet.  Sometimes it
works for me, sometimes not.  I don't know whether its because I don't
know what I'm doing, bugs in git, or changes in the calling syntax.

(NB, "git rebase" is basically just what the Arch people call "tla
update", and darcs's claim to fame is that you don't need to
distinguish between a rebase and a simple pull, darcs calculates it
for you.)

Shouldn't the "until" in the doc be "while"?  Alternatively, "true"
could be changed to "false".

Not to diverge py-dev too far into the depths of DRCS usage, but are
you doing anything particularly complex ?  While I wouldn't say I do
it regularly, I certainly consider it part and parcel of general git
usage, and I've always found it works well for me.  Rebasing is one of
the features that really convinced me git was a cut above the rest,
obviously along with the ease of merging.

For those that are interested the ultra brief explanation for git
branching is that it stores all your branches in the one directory
structure.  You "git checkout" to switch between branches, which
causes all the managed files in your directory to be changed to
reflect the state branch you are changing to.

Sure. However, you *can* specify multiple jar files on the command
line, in the class path.

java -cp xerces.jar -jar xalan2.jar

This runs xalan2.jar, but adds xerces.jar to the class path. It
has all the advantages of a command line option compared to
setting CLASSPATH: it won't be inherited to subprocesses, and
you can use it on Windows, too, whereas you cannot set environment
variables in the command line on Windows.

So while -z strictly gives the equivalent -jar, it's actually
-cp that is used much more often in Java (I think), and that
doesn't have an equivalent in Python still. My typical usage
of java goes like this

java -cp <endless list of jar files> the.main.class

The equivalent Python line would be

python -p <path> -m main_module

There are several places where "64-bitness" need to be considered:
you need to set the architecture of the entire MSI file, and the
installer sets it to "x64" ("Intel64" means Itanium).

In addition, you can set the Win64 bit on components, and
msilib sets it on all components, AFAIK.

Please take a look at msilib.set_arch_from_file. This takes an
executable file, determines the processor architecture, and then
sets both MSI type (the PID_TEMPLATE SummaryInformation field),
and the Win64 variable, which should cause all components to
become Win64 components (i.e. flag 256 being set).

I suspect I'm still missing something here.  The title of the page you
referenced before is "Using 64-Bit Windows Installer Packages" - I suspect
that is different than a 32-Bit installer package installing a 64bit
program!

Yes - that is a bit of a shame, as having 32bit components would allow more
flexibility (eg, allow a 64bit install of Python to work with an IIS
configured for 32bit extensions), but that's something we can deal with
later if necessary.

using _winreg is (almost) like using the API directly.
RegDisable[/Enable]ReflectionKey appears to let the 32bit process see the
real keys - I'm not aware of how 64bit apps would enable that reflection,
but it probably doesn't really matter for our purposes.  In case anyone is
interested, I just made a patch to _winreg.c adding these 2 functions
(http://python.org/sf/1753245) in case anyone would like to review it.

I think Tools\msi is what you are looking for, but hopefully Martin will
chime in.  I'm more than happy to help test.

You might be looking at the wrong version. In Python 2.5, it also
sets it to x64, if the PE machine type is 0x8664.

Right. That's why I provide three installers.

That's correct. I'm also uncertain what precisely the Win64 flag
on a component means, according to

http://msdn2.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/aa368007.aspx

msidbComponentAttributes64bit means

# Set this bit to mark this as a 64-bit component. This attribute
# facilitates the installation of packages that include both 32-bit and
# 64-bit components. If this bit is not set, the component is registered
# as a 32-bit component.
#
# If this is a 64-bit component replacing a 32-bit component, set this
# bit and assign a new GUID in the ComponentId column.

When I started to work on this, I found that not setting the Win64
bit at all "does not work", although I forgot the details what precisely
failed.

I found some articles in the net that suggest that this flag turns
off redirection, e.g.

http://blogs.msdn.com/heaths/archive/2006/04/14/avoid-overwriting-files-in-administrative-installations.aspx

As we don't want any redirection, setting the flag on all components
should be correct.

Why do you say that? What registry keys do you think it creates,
and what registry keys do you think it should create instead?

There are no "64-bit registry keys" on Windows; Win64 only
has "normal registry keys" and "32-bit (i.e. redirected)
registry keys".

I always test whether the AMD 64 binary installs correctly before

You don't need to provide patches - just tell me what's wrong with
the MSI file. I.e. look at it in orca, correct it so that it works
correctly, then report what changes you made.

Right. You cannot easily have a 32-bit installer install 64-bit
programs. That will normally not work, as Windows will silently
redirect all registry keys to the Wow6432Node, so it won't
"see" the registry keys that the Win64 program sees.

The only way to "see" the same keys as a 64-bit process would
do is to specify KEY_WOW64_64KEY when opening the key.

Can you elaborate? It's incorrect for a Win64 installer to make the
executable components Win32. A 64 bit pythonxy.dll cannot work in
a 32-bit IIS - it's a different instruction set. That's not something
that you can fix by just installing things differently.

They can specify KEY_WOW64_32KEY.

Fair point. Doesn't it argue that there are valid uses for both -p and
-z (in Python terms)? I'm not expert in Java usage, but on Windows,
.jar files are associated with javaw -jar "%1" %*, which would
reinforce the suggestion that Python have a .pyz extension associated
with pythonw -z "%1" %*. Note the -w (GUI) form of both of these...

As of git 1.5.0.something, "git rebase --onto NEWBASE UPSTREAM" just
ignored the --onto flag AFAICT.  As I say, I may have been abusing it
to do something inappropriate.  Basically I wanted to take the tip of
BRANCH (which was experimental, but I'd accidentally done a bunch of
generic typo fixing) and graft it onto the mainline.

Indeed it does.  I'd be happy for there to be a -p that allows both Windows 
and Unix users to prepend to sys.path.  It should also be separate from 
the -z (or whatever that gets called).

Actually, I think it *is* a typo:  the last part should read that no
output is produced until the predicate becomes *false*.

(Sorry about top-posting: I'm using my blackberry while waiting for
the bus and my gmail client doesn't do quoting :-( )

Certainly java won't let you specify -jar more than once, because that
would be telling it to *run* two files.  It *will*, however, let you
specify more than one jar in the classpath.  This is done all the
time, making the contents of those jars available for importing.

These aren't typically combined, since the whole point of running a
jar file is to have a single distributed package, but IIRC it is not
prohibited.

We can probably assume that none of the Linux kernel team are developing 
on Windows. There is probably s a group with relevant experience 
somewhere. I'd Google for it, but I expect that the results would be 
dominated by British assertions that "you have to be a stupid git to run

I haven't worked with it enough to know all the intracacies, but the
short of what I know is if your template is i386, you can only install
to 32-bit locations. If it is x64 or Intel64, then you can only
install on machines of those architectures, and the 64-bit locations
become available to components marked as 64-bit.

http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384129.aspx describes the
KEY_WOW64_64KEY and KEY_WOW64_32KEY flags, allowing explicit access to
either set from either type of application.

Thanks, and I see he has, and perhaps I've been looking at an incorrect file...

I've looked most closely at
http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Lib/msilib/__init__.py?rev=47280&view=auto,
and from there not even full readings yet, just searching for Win64 to
see what the flag did. No doubt I have missed several intracacies.

It may well be fine for the Python installers. Without the flag,
locations such as the 64-bit folder destinations resolve to the 32-bit
redirected locations, and the registry resolves to the 32-bit
reflected registry. The former isn't particularly helpful in any case
I can think of (as the non 64-bit locations are available anyway), but
the latter could be important if an 64-bit install needs to set 32-bit
registry keys.

Perhaps it's my reading the wrong version (the one I linked above
doesn't even have the string x64), or my assumption that msilib would
target a more general use case than pure 64-bit / pure 32-bit
installers. Or I missed the easy way to interleave 64 and 32-bit
components.

I find that nomenclature distinction to be more confusing than
referring to them "incorrectly" :)

And I ran no tests at all, so I defer to you here.

That's even easier then, if anything's actually wrong. I'll find some
time this weekend to look at it and report back. Would the one at the
following URL be the correct one to verify?

Ah, but you *can* use some quite clever quoting to get that effect.  
E.g. this starts up python with /usr/bin/env and a -O argument:

#!/bin/sh
""""exec /usr/bin/env python -O $0 "$@";" """

Credit for this trick originally belong to someone else: I found this  
on some website, but I don't know where anymore.

I'll leave it as a exercise to the reader to figure out how it works. :)

Assuming this is the right file, the cause of the behavior Mark
reported is pretty clear. While the template summary is indeed x64,
the attributes on the registry components are all 4 instead of 256 |
4, so they are placed in the 32-bit reflected registry. I don't know
if this is desirable for some other reason.

Ah, ok. This should get fixed, but it isn't use to create the installer.
Instead, look at

http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Tools/msi/msilib.py?rev=55245&view=markup

Why should it? I have yet to see a use case for that.

I found the same thing, and put a corrected installer at

Mark, can you please report whether that fixes your problem?

Mailman switch to Bazaar on June 22. The transition went pretty  
smoothly (the hardest part of the process was shutting off write  
access to Subversion ;).  I know some of us were talking about it at  
Pycon, but I've now been using it for 4 or 5 more months.  It's  
really a top-notch dvcs and I think it would bring a lot of benefit  
to the Python community.

I'll see if I can set up some public bzr mirrors of our svn  
repository for people to try it out.  Or you could just use the bzr- 
svn plugin to get a local repository.

There are lots of key benefits to using a dvcs, but IMO the most  
important is that it helps democratize the development process, and  
makes it much easier for the core to review and accept  
contributions.  diffs are so 20th century. :)

Silly me, the trunk is already available:

https://code.launchpad.net/~vcs-imports/python/trunk

I could certainly request that other branches be mirrored if there's  
any interest.  Should the community ever decide to make the switch, I  
believe the entire Subversion history could be imported, though we  
may not care about the majority of existing branches.

Actually, I do regularly use both classpath and -jar with java because
I'm running a .jar file that does not contain "the world".  OTOH, this
is a development environment rather than a production environment, so
theoretically I could just shove everything into the .jar file -- but I
don't because that adds more time to the compile/link/jarjarjar cycle.

Well okay, you caught me being flippant. :)

Sure, you visually compare with diffs, but you apply those changes  
with merges.  This means the end of posting patches because instead  
what you would do is post the url to a branch that you published some  
place.  It means that branch can be kept up-to-date as its parent  
branch changes, so a new feature candidate need never get stale.  It  
also means your new feature candidate is a first class revision  
control branch, just as usable as the trunk, say.  So it's much more  
powerful than trading patch files around.

More powerful, maybe, but also more limitating.

Do you still have the "patch" metodologie? How can you provide a patch
if you don't have a place to publish the change?

But how do you publish stuff? Do you need to run your own web server on
your dial-up machine?

I simply cannot imagine that all contributors have access to some
machine that is always online and willing to host bzr patches (which
is necessary IIUC).

Why not just an __init__.py, which you would normally execute if you
tried to import/run a directory?

Treating zip files (and only zip files) as a special case equivalent
to uncompressed files seems like a wart; I would prefer not to
special-case zips any more than they already are.

If anything, I would like to see the -m option enhanced so that if it
gets a recognized "collection" file type (including a directory or
zip), it does the right thing.  Whether that actually makes sense, or
defeats the purpose of the -m shortcut, I'm not sure.

It doesn't today; it does use circular imports, which can be a problem.

I have seen it recommended as the right place to store global
(cross-module) settings.

You could, but you certainly don't need to.  For example, Launchpad 
[1] hosts bzr code branches for anyone working on open source  
software.  Sign in (for free of course) and start pushing your own  
branches immediately[2].

However, there's also no reason why other such services couldn't be  
deployed, perhaps even hosted by the PSF, just like we do with  
Subversion.  The difference is that it doesn't matter because unlike  
running multiple Subversion repositories, dvcs's in general are  
designed to be distributed (duh :).

Having access is easy.  Self-publishing might not be something people  
want to do (it's certainly not something I want to do), but that's  
not a requirement.

[1] <http://www.launchpad.net> which is a service provided by  
Canonical.  Full disclosure: I work for them.  But I'm not touting  
that as a company shill; I really do think that bzr and the Launchpad  
code hosting service provide a lot of benefit.  Be your own judge.

You can still have a patch methodology if your internet connection  
really sucks.  But if you have good enough access to the current  
Subversion repository, then you probably have good enough access to  
use a free branch hosting service like Launchpad.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Building Python with CMake
Message-ID: <200707131359.17030.alex.neundorf@kitware.com>

Hi,

as I wrote in my previous email, I'm currently porting Python to some more 
unusual platforms, namely to a super computer 
(http://www.research.ibm.com/bluegene/) and a tiny embedded operating system 
(http://ecos.sourceware.org), which have more or less surprisingly quite 
similar properties.

To do this, I added CMake files to Python, in order to use CMake to cross 
compile Python to these platforms. CMake (http://www.cmake.org) is a 
buildsystem in scope similar to autotools, but it's just one tool (instead of 
a collection of tools) and it support Windows and the MS compilers as first 
class citizens, i.e. it can not only generate Makefiles, but also project 
files for the various versions of Visual Studio, and also for XCode.

Attached you can find the files I had to add to get this working. With these 
CMake files I was able to build python for eCos, BlueGene, Linux and Windows 
(with Visual Studio 2003, but here I simply reused the existing pyconfig.h, 
because I didn't want to spend to much time with this). 
So for Linux the configure checks should be already quite good and almost 
complete, for eCos and BlueGene they also work (both are UNIX-like), for 
Windows there is probably some tweaking required.

So if anybody is interested in trying to use CMake for Python, you can find 
the files attached. Version 2.4.5 of CMake or newer is required.

I guess I should mention that I'm doing this currently with the released 
Python 2.5.1.

Bye
Alex

Subject: [Python-Dev] Alternative to -z option
Message-ID: <20070713180813.E80293A40AE@sparrow.telecommunity.com>

After thinking about it some more, I suggest that instead of using a 
special option to execute a zipfile, we simply always get an importer 
for the script filename.  If the importer is imp.NullImporter, then 
we do normal script processing.  Otherwise, we set set sys.path[0] = 
sys.argv[0] = script, and import __main__.

This will support zipfiles and directories, Windows and Unix, even 
using "env" (since no option to the interpreter is required).

Thoughts?

The same as anywhere else; it'll just always be true.  :)

No, for two reasons.  First, importing __main__ always returns 
whatever the start script is using as a __main__ module.  Second, 
even if you're in the middle of __main__ itself, the module is 
already in sys.modules.  So this is a non-issue.

Yes, but it won't work unless the overall program was launched via 
*that particular* __main__.py -- running from the interpreter prompt 
for example, those values won't be there.  So, people will learn 
quickly why that doesn't work.

I think it can be replaced with using standard importer detection of 
sys.argv[0], to decide whether it is an importable location 
(dir/zip), and then importing __main__, with fallback to the old 
script behavior.  This is forward-compatible with other import 
mechanisms, and supports #! lines better for zipfiles, since no -z 
option is needed.

Let me get this right: if I had a one-liner hello.py (containing the
line print "Hello, world") all I'd need to do is

(1) rename hello.py to __main__.py
(2) zip hello.zip __main__.py.

Then,

    python hello.zip

would work exactly as python hello.py did previously?

Sounds plausible. I'm not entirely clear on the details of the code
needed (long day!) - would you be willing to produce a patch? (One
major point in favour of the -z patch is that it exists already!)

Paul.

The last time, I was asked to write a PEP. I would demand the same
thing the next time such a switch is suggested.

I would be -1 on any proposed switch to a system that hasn't made
its 1.0 release yet (myself, I've used subversion since 0.21, and
I certainly don't want to go back to these times).

Martin

Yes, the branch is update regularly. I think it's done nightly.
The last checkin is from Georg Brandl for patch #1675424.

Sorry, missed the previous mail. Have two questions for you:

- Why?

- Do you know if there're plans for support this two platforms beyond
this porting?

Thank you!!

All DCVS's I looked at had a simple file export for 'changes'. It's diff +
metadata, basically, which means it includes renames, directory mutation,
changelogs, change-dependency information (which 'revision' it is based on,
in effect) and whatever else the DCVS needs or wants. You can toss those
around just like you can toss around diffs.

Why porting or why using cmake ?
Porting because of VTK (http://www.vtk.org), cmake because it has really good 
support for cross compiling (cvs version of cmake). And it has the nice side 
effect that the manually maintained MSVC project files would not be required 
anymore.

BlueGene is for running VTK on it, and this will be supported for the coming 
years. eCos was for testing the cross compile, since this is easier to work 
with than with BlueGene. I don't know if there will be users for Python on 
eCos, but then again I didn't have to change anything to get it working on 
eCos, the configure checks did it all.

git doesn't support Windows in a way that Windows users would find reasonable. 
In fact, the only ones saying it does already support Windows are non-Windows 
users.

hg has a much more mature Windows support. In fact, I didn't face any major 
problems in using it under Windows (even in the details: eg, it supports 
case-insensitive filesystems).

No. I never talked about moving us over. I do not believe and have never
believed that to be feasible (in the foreseeable future.) It is certainly
possible to host a project of Python's size, depth of history and number of
committers in a DVCS (Monotone is my personal favourite, with Mercurial and
Bazaar a shared second), and certain things would go a _lot_ better with
proper branch tracking and merging, but switching over Python means an
entirely new way of working, educating all the developers and working around
the limitations of the chosen system. (I'm not saying they have more
limitations than Subversion per se, but we are already used to working
around Subversion's limitations.)

What I talked about was converting the monolithic p3yk branch to a
collection of separate feature-branches, which would then be merged together
into "the py3k branch", as well as the trunk (for backported changes.) The
p3yk branch contains many changes that will never be backported, mixed in
with change we want in Python 2.6. We currently do manual merging from the
trunk into p3yk. When we start backporting features, those features in the
trunk will end up conflicting with the p3yk changes. Worse, we will need to
manually track bugfixes to those features in the p3yk branch in order to
apply them to the trunk, and take extra care when merging in bugfixes from
the trunk, too. Because Subversion don't keep track of which chunk was
already merged, you get a lot of spurious conflicts. It gets extremely
tedious to do those merges manually, and the error rate raises
significantly. (I already have an uncomfortable feeling that I missed some
of the merges in the p3yk branch, leaving bugs in p3yk that were fixed in
the trunk. Fortunately, tests catch them fairly quickly -- but we still
don't have 100% test coverage, not even for newly fixed bugs.)

I have been working on converting the p3yk branch into separate Bazaar[*]
branches, by first converting the whole branch (with 'tailor') and then
applying each changeset to an appropriate feature branch, creating them as
needed (using a little script based on tailor, because cherrypicking doesn't
quite do what I want.) The last half year of changes, though, gets so
incredibly intertwined that it's quite hard to pull them apart. Furthermore,
I would still have to merge them back together to create the original py3k
branch, and do merges with the trunk, too.

I've been forced to decide it's not worth it, at this point. If we'd started
with separate feature-branches earlier, it would have been. Now, it's easier
and less error prone to just suck it up and deal with the numerous conflicts
backported features will create. (Since I will be doing much backporting
myself, I'm not just letting someone else deal with the mess :-)

Some-branch-of-me'ly y'rs,

[*] Bazaar was chosen for a number of unimportant reasons that are entirely
moot at this point. It doesn't reflect my personal preference or constitute
any form of official endorsement :-)

Because it would be a single unified build system instead of having two build 
systems like we have one (UNIX and Windows).

Also, it would be much easier to maintain because Visual Studio projects are 
generated from a simple description, while right now if you want to change 
something you need to go through the hassle of defining it within the Visual 
Studio GUI.

Consider for instance if you want to change the Windows build so that a 
builtin module is compiled as an external .pyd instead. Right now, you need to 
go through the hassle of manually defining a new project, setting all the 
include/libraries dependencies correctly, ecc. ecc. With CMake or a similar 
tool, it would be a matter of a couple of textual line changes.

[ I'll also remember that "ease of maintanance for developers" is the #1 
reason for having a 2.1Mb python25.dll under Windows, which I would really 
love to reduce. ]

Let's not start a discussion on which DVCS is better, or I'd burn your ears
off about all the ways each of those (as well as Bazaar, Arch/tla/bzr1, Arx,
CodeVille, SVK, Monotone and BitKeeper) suck, suck badly or are the work of
the devil. The official Python source repository will be Subversion for now
(although it isn't officially my decision :). I encourage anyone to use a
mirror of it in their own favourite VCS, and do their own development in it.
'tailor' is a nice tool if you care about having the full history (as I do)
and you don't happen to hit bugs in it or the VCS. Do realize that the full
history may be a burden, especially in DVCS solutions.

For what it's worth, rumour has it Subversion 1.5 or 2.0 will get actual
branch tracking and full-history merging. If done properly (it's not done
yet, so it's hard to say) it would reduce the advantage of the DVCS
solutions by about half ;-P

As you mention, 64 and 32bit programs use different instruction sets.
Therefore, trying to use a 64bit install of Python with IIS configured to
work with 32bits is not going to work.  In this case, switching the
configuration of IIS will require the Python user to uninstall the previous
version and install a different version - but some sites may end up in a
dilemma here - they may be *forced* to use IIS in 32bit mode due to no 64bit
port for a tool they need, but simultaneously desire a 64bit build of Python
for other tasks on that same box.

> It's incorrect for a Win64 installer to make the executable components
Win32.

Right - I got the impression from Micheal that it was possible for 32bit
components to be installed in a 64bit install, but I don't profess to know
anything about this.

Exactly - which is why I'm suggesting that not "allowing" 64bit and 32bit
versions of Python to be installed on the same box will cause inconvenience
for some people.  I agree such people will be in the minority, and their
requirements are not clear, so I'm not pushing for a change of policy here.

While I don't necessarily agree (and await for that burning feeling to
start in my ears ;-) ), I think the lack of a decent windows port for
some, and general lack of real maturity in most, are the killer
arguments against DRCS for Python at this point.

My own DRCS of preference (git) has a method for pulling from
subversion anyway, and I can't really claim to even contribute much
directly _to_ Python's core, so I'm wary of claiming to be too
invested in this.  That said, there are always strong arguments in
favour of the distributed model encouraging and fostering community
dev participation - and code always speaks louder than words heh.

Indeed. Is there any need to restrict extensions to

Well, you might have multiple executable .py files in the same source
tree.  So then you would want to build multiple .pyz files, each of
which has a different __zipmain__.

I think of __zipmain__ as part of the format of the .pyz file, not
part of the source tree.  In particular, it specifies what
module/function to run in the zipped source tree (and I imagine it
will be adapted for other uses).  In this model you're separating your
development tree and the thing you deploy, which is not always the
case in Python.

IIUC, you want the AMD64 installer also deploy 32-bit pythonxy.dll etc.
That's a challenge, of course: how would you install the 32-bit
extension modules so that they don't interfere with the 64-bit ones?

That is true. However, there really isn't anything special about a 32bit
component: the only difference is that Installer turns on file and
registry redirection when installing that component.

You are free to put 32-bit executables into 64-bit components just fine.
(A "component" in MSI is a group of files and registry keys that is
installed together).

Even some moderately-experienced Python developers confuse the 
concepts of "package" and "directory containing Python code" -- let's 
not make it worse by encouraging the inclusion of an __init__ module 
in the top-level package namespace!

-m deals with the package namespace as it already stands - it knows 
nothing whatsoever about the underlying filesystem (and that's 
deliberate - the runpy module relies on PEP 302 to abstract away all 
those details).

On Phillip's idea regarding being able to execute directories and zip 
files, I think the semantics would actually be manageable (as 
directories and zip files can be definitely identified), but I'd be 
concerned as to the startup cost for checking what is being executed.

Cheers,
Nick.

Just to clarify, my patch already works with uncompressed directory
trees just fine.  It's just a matter of naming, I suppose.

I don't mind calling it -z and using it for directories.  But mainly
that's because no one has proprosed another name. : )  I think we've
agreed that -p is something totally different.

Where?  People use __main__.py now?  That seems bad, because __ names
are reserved, so they should just use main.py, I would think.

We could use -r ("run"), or -X ("execute"); not sure those are really right 
either.

I've seen __main__ suggested as a place to store application-specific global 
settings, but not for a long time.  I don't think it was ever mapped directly 
to a file on disk though.

I find the idea really hackish.

Well, the start file is being opened and checked for directory-ness 
already, and it has to be read to be executed.  The extra reading to 
see if it's a zipfile isn't likely to be much additional overhead.

At this point I've got a partial patch.  It figures out when it 
should import __main__, but it's not successful at actually doing 
so.  It seems that simply importing or reloading '__main__' doesn't 
work, because it's considered a built-in module.  Apparently, I'll 
have to explicitly load the module via the found importer.

Just for the record: Python's development model *is* distributed,
and has been for a long time. We don't all work in the same office,
or even in the same time zone. We rarely meet face-to-face (although
the recent hiring wave at Google has changed some of that - but
then, there also was ZC, BeOpen, CNRI before that).

I really don't think that the non-D aspect of the VCS is a burden to
contribution. Many patches are contributed from the released source,
i.e. without bothering to check out anything, or even from the binary
installation, i.e. without bothering to download and build the source.
People who don't use subversion to get themselves the latest sources to
contribute against won't start doing so if some other system was
used (they are less likely to if they have to learn it first).

Instead, requiring contributors to use the Python VCS would place
a burden, as does the requirement that we already have to contribute
diff files, rather than an edited version of the original file. Also,
having to register with the bugtracker is a burden for some
contributors.

Martin

No; they don't use a file.  It is treated as a strictly dynamic
scratchpad, and they do things like

    import __main__
    __main__.DEBUGLEVEL=5
    if __main__.myvar: ...

Without wanting to have a discussion about the semantics of what it is
to be "distributed", what it seems (to me at least) that you're saying
is that the python community itself is distributed.  That's doesn't
mean that your versioning is distributed.  The model you describe is
very much centralised, where many people submit patches to a central
source repository - otherwise SVN would already be a distributed RCS.
 The model you describe isn't quite the distributed method of
operation where you have many repos that can be pulled and merged
together - I won't attempt to rehash Linus' Google Tech Talk,
  See here : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8)
of the distributed model he uses, if only because so many python-dev
members work for Google now ;-)

No certainly not, I'm not by any means suggesting that the current way
of handling revision control is having a negative impact.  I also
don't intend to evangelize.  But there are arguments to be put that a
DRCS can promote more involvement by allowing people to checkout and
work on their own copy of the tree.  This way they can cut code in a
controlled environment using commits, reverts, version diffs etc
without the necessity of setting up their own svn repo to commit to,
or needing a sandbox in the python repo.

Generally I agree with you, for bugfixing etc it's unlikely that if
they didn't participate before, an RCS change won't suddenly change
their mind.  That said, I think the number of people that know SVN
beyond update and commit are few and far between as well - I'd suggest
the real distinctions between distributed and non-distributed apps at
this level are virtually nil for such simple use cases.

The learning curve is definitely one of the key impediments to any
change to the RCS used.  The last thing you want to do is cause
unreasonable difficulty for the people who are already contributing to
the project; it's not much use to have encouraged 20 new developers
only to lose 20 existing ones.  But it's worth considering the balance
between costs and benefits, for example being able to branch virtually
instantly without modifying the python.org repository is a big win I'd
think.  Being able to more easily modularise the maintenance and
responsibility load for the source tree is another win, especially as
the size of the tree grows and new efforts such as Py3k begin.

With respect to bugtracking, well that's probably a separate issue
really.  However if there's a way to integrate a bugtracker with my
RCS in a way that lets me create and resolve tickets when I'm offline,
someone please tell me :-)

Cheers
Dave

ARAIK, the only disk fromat that really cares about this which may still
be in widespread use is ISO-9660-formatted CDs without Joliet/Rock Ridge
extensions.  Also, it seems that memory sticks and USB thumb drives are
often formatted with FAT because that's the closest we have to a
universal file format.

I think they tend to use FAT32 (the ones I've seen do), which does
support long filenames and more than 3 character extensions.

I'd check with the guys doing the Portable Python and Movable Python stuff
to see if they see >-three-char extensions as a problem.

    http://www.portablepython.com/
    http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/movpy/

They both seem to be Window-centric so they've pretty much been off my radar
screen.

For me, .pyz is fine.  Python has more or less a trademark on .pyx 
extensions, and one more fits well.  I think we should stick with them.

Confusion of .pyz with .py.z is not an issue with Windows users, though I 
can understand how it might be for *nix users.  On the other hand, pyzip is 
quite similar (too similar?) to pkzip.

In general, this is not true. FAT16 can address a 2GB device and I can 
think of at least one embedded system I am working with that does not 
support FAT32. If anything, at least .pyzip reduces to .pyz in 8dot3 
(whereas .py.z reduces to .z *yikes!*). However, I think it is still 
best practice to aim for 8dot3 naming.

The three-letter extension namespace is very small and heavily
overloaded.  There's no such thing as a previously unused three-letter
extension; it's bound to conflict with something, even if we don't
know what it is.  It's not best practice to restrict yourself to
short, cryptic, ambiguous names unless you have to.

For stuff hardwired into the interpreter, I agree it's safer to stick
with 8+3.  But this is just the default association created by the
installer.  If it's creating problems, you can always rename your
files to .pyz or whatever you like and create an association for that.

I'm a little surprised that people are suffering 8+3 names on their
usb drives in this day and age still.  I suppose if I had to deal with
that, I would just zip/tar up my long-file-named files in an 8+3-named
archive.  And since a .pyz-file is just such an archive, I concede the
point and withdraw my suggestion.

Is there any intention to update the msi at python.org?  Alternatively, can
I point people at the above file?  I've a .msi created by bdist_msi that
works only with the corrected version and I'm wondering the best way to get
people to test it...

Cheers,

Mark.

I completely intend to finish the backlog of summaries, but I've
reached the point that I know it is futile to continue thinking I'll
be able to fit in the time for the summaries in an on-going and
reliable manner. When I took on the responsibility, it was looking
like time would be fine. Since then, I had to move, my work load has
at least tripled, children prove more time consumer once they learn to
walk, and I'm even having to look at the possibility of expanding
beyond a one-man operation.

When I took the position, I had the time. My situation only lasted
that way for a couple weeks. Every time I think it will change,
something else happens. At this point, I can't keep fooling myself.
But, as I said, I absolutely will be finishing the summaries I have
not done, to make up for my mistakes with this. I haven't even had the
time to read python-dev during all these months, much less write about
them.

Becoming involved with the upcoming Python Magazine is just the
evidence I needed that my life is not as care free as it was when I
thought I could make time for this.

Is anyone interested in taking the (much dwindled) flame from my unable hands?

I wouldn't worry about trying to catch up, Calvin.  I am sure people
are appreciative you just tried to take on the load.

No. I would have to bump the version number for that, which I cannot

That's certainly fine. I can leave the file in place at least until
2.5.2 is released (although I will eventually remove it, to reduce
confusion).

Message-ID: <ee2a432c0707191652n439abedao5641d8d8b6519a45@mail.gmail.com>

It's about that time of year again.  We are starting to organize
Python sprints again this year hosted at Google (ie, there was a 5
minute conversation and a couple of emails).  Nothing has solidified
yet, but here are our ideas:

 * Hosted at Google's headquarters in Mountain View, CA USA
 * From Wed, Aug 22 to Sat Aug 25 (4 days)
 * Cost: free, but need to code for food and internet :-)

How does that work for people?  You can attend for as little or as
much time as you want. I expect most people will focus on py3k--the
core language changes as well as tools to support the transition.

We'd like to start figuring out how many people would be attending.
If you are interested, please mail me privately.  You don't need to
commit to anything.  Just how likely you are to attend.  Could someone
update the wiki we used for last years sprints:
http://wiki.python.org/moin/GoogleSprint

If you would be interested in other locations/dates, let me know.  I
don't know that we can accommodate anything else, but we can try.

Cheers,
n

Message-ID: <23f4e3390707200011q41af8a83sa2675412e030ba84@mail.gmail.com>

Has anyone tried PyGEGL, the Python interface to gegl (www.gegl.org),
with SVN Python?
When I 'import gegl', that causes an immediate crash with the
following backtrace.

I'm pretty sure that the bug lies in either Python or the pygegl module, as I've
ran the babl and gegl tests successfully (and the gegl editor
works okay too)

(btw, this is with both SVN python and SVN gegl -- PyGEGL is included
in the gegl repository; in order to test this, you might also need the
SVN version of babl. Lastly, in the gegl tree, you can find PyGEGL
source in the bindings/pygegl/ dir.)

I posted this report originally to the gegl-developer list.

Kevin Cozens, the PyGEGL maintainer, said:

Hence I'm posting it here. Perhaps someone can shed some light on what
is happening here?

I would wager a beer or two that the issue is in the wrapping of gegl.
Having recently started wrapping modules by hand and with Swig, I have
come to notice that making a mistake with refcounts can lead to
segfaults like you are seeing.  If you are getting that immediately upon
import, you may want to check to make sure that the function that is
initializing your module (typically something like init_gegl) is doing
the right things (I can't really offer any suggestions on what to check
for, I literally only started wrapping stuff by hand yesterday;
previously I used Pyrex, which can handle all refcounts for you if
desired).

The most likely culprit is that some of the code is using PyMem_Free on 
a pointer allocated with PyObject_Malloc (or vice-versa). This has 
always been illegal, but prior to 2.5 the Python memory allocator tied 
itself in knots to try to avoid crashing when client code broke the 
rules. The changes in 2.5 to release unused memory back to the OS 
required that those knots be cut.

The what's new document for each release is a good resource for these 
kinds of problems, especially its porting section:

http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/porting.html

Cheers,
Nick.

Subject: [Python-Dev] uuid creation not thread-safe?
Message-ID: <ca471dc20707201052p68883fc5l3efd8ecc5cfd497f@mail.gmail.com>

I discovered what appears to be a thread-unsafety in uuid.py. This is
in the trunk as well as in 3.x; I'm using the trunk here for easy
reference. There's some code around like 395:

    import ctypes, ctypes.util
    _buffer = ctypes.create_string_buffer(16)

This creates a *global* buffer which is used as the output parameter
to later calls to _uuid_generate_random() and _uuid_generate_time().
For example, around line 481, in uuid1():

        _uuid_generate_time(_buffer)
        return UUID(bytes=_buffer.raw)

Clearly if two threads do this simultaneously they are overwriting
_buffer in unpredictable order. There are a few other occurrences of
this too.

I find it somewhat disturbing that what seems a fairly innocent
function that doesn't *appear* to have global state is nevertheless
not thread-safe. Would it be wise to fix this, e.g. by allocating a
fresh output buffer inside uuid1() and other callers?

Subject: [Python-Dev] [ANN] Python documentation team looking for members!
Message-ID: <f7sn4a$5eh$2@sea.gmane.org>

Dear fellow Pythonistas,

as you may have heard, Python is going to get a new documentation system
soon [1].  As part of that effort, and in order to maintain the excellent
quality of the docs, we are looking for members of the maintainers team.
This is your chance to get involved with Python development!

There will be two main objectives of the group, or maybe two subgroups can
be formed:

* Maintaining the documentation contents:
   - processing user submitted comments, bugs and patches
   - helping out developers with docs-related matters, keeping an eye
     on commits to ensure quality
   - keeping the docs up-to-date, e.g. write new sections for new
     Python 3000 features

   The docs source will be in reStructuredText, which is already known to a
   relatively high percentage of Python developers.

   The new online version of the docs will contain features to add comments
   and suggest changes, so it is expected that there will be some amount
   of user involvement.


* Development of the toolset:
   - fixing bugs in the package
   - adding new output formats, e.g. info or pdf
   - adding new features to the web application
   - adapting it to new docutils features

   The software is written in pure Python. It is currently located in the
   docutils Subversion repository, at
   http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/docutils/trunk/sandbox/py-rest-doc/

   The README file gives you a rough idea what you find there and how to
   get started, all other questions can be directed to georg at python.org,
   I'll answer them gladly.


An additional objective in the near future will, of course, be handling the
switch to the new system.

Okay, so you've read until here? And you're interested in joining the team?
Wow! Write to the docs at python.org and become a documentation maintainer!

cheers,
Georg


[1] see http://pyside.blogspot.com/2007/06/introducing-py-rest-doc.html
     for some details, and http://pydoc.gbrandl.de:3000/ [2] for a demo.
     (Commenting doesn't work yet, but it's worked upon fiercely...)

[2] the demo server is a small vserver with the application served by a
     single wsgiref instance, and as such not fit to handle large amounts
     of requests, so it may well be that you don't get good reponse times.

Instead of requiring a -z flag, why not have the interpreter peak at
the file to see if it starts with one of the ZIP magic numbers?

That way it Just Works.

Hello,

I am e-mailing you because I am looking for a way to use the CJK  
codecs and the CJK module that I found for Python.

I wasn't able to find any documentation on how to use it so I would  
appreciate it if you would let me know where I could find it.

Thank you in advance.

Message-ID: <596909b30707102339j4bab06c8i45132a6a9dc7e2a@mail.gmail.com>

I'd like to request comments on this patch I submitted:

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1739468&group_id=5470&atid=305470

There are many details given in the comments on that page.

This can be used to deploy Python programs in a very lightweight and
cross-platform way.  You could imagine a cgi script or a light web app
server being deployed like this.  I have personally deployed Python
programs using zip files and this would get rid of the need for
boilerplate needed for each platform.

The good thing about this is that it's extremely simple -- basically
20 lines of C code to add a -z flag that calls a 3-line Python
function in the runpy module.

I don't believe it overlaps with anything that already exists.  py2exe
and py2app are platform specific and bundle the Python interpreter.
This will be a cross platform binary that doesn't bundle the Python
interpreter.  It doesn't require eggs but I think it would work fine
with eggs, and could help fix a little bug as I mentioned on the patch
page.

Nick Coghlan has reviewed the patch and seems to think it's a good
idea.  Thomas Wouters also said he likes it, and I ran it by Guido
earlier and he seemed to think the idea is good, although I don't
think he has seen the implementation.

thanks,
Andy

I guess you wouldn't recognize a zip file if it hits you in the face.
Literally. :-)

Zip files don't start with a magic number.

Don't they end with a sentinel? If so, what would be the difference?

There's an ambiguity -- a Zip file could start with a Python (or
shell, or Perl) script that bootstraps execution. This is used
regularly. Changing the semantics just because the file *ends* with
something funny sounds like asking for trouble.

I've actually started on a patch that uses the standard import hooks 
to figure out how to import __main__ from sys.argv[0], if it's 
something that an import hook can be found for (otherwise, it falls 
back to normal behavior).

At this point, the problem is that __main__ is a builtin module and 
already exists when this processing is being done, so trying to 
reload it in a straightforward way doesn't work.  (Nor does using the 
standard -m logic.)

If I can figure out how to work around that bit, we won't need a -z 
flag, which means a #! line for zipfiles is possible on 'nix, and we 
can support arbitrary import hooks for sys.argv[0].  (Assuming 
they're either built-in or registered via sitecustomize, that is.)

Actually, it isn't, because you can't start a zipfile with a Python 
script.  Lord knows I've *tried*, but the Python interpreter just 
won't accept arbitrary binary data as part of a script.  :)

Second, unless you somehow managed to overcome that little obstacle, 
you're not going to be trying to run the zipfile with the Python 
interpreter, anyway.  Instead, the #! line (or .exe header on 
Windows) will be invoking whatever interpreter or program actually 
works for that file.

Third, if you mistakenly pass an existing such zipfile to a new 
Python interpreter that supports zipfiles, and there's no 
__main__.py* file in it, you're just going to get a different error 
message than the syntax error you'd have received from an older 
Python.interpreter to run it with -- but otherwise no difference.

In other words, AFAICT there's really no ambiguity here.

That bit me a while back, hard enough that I thought of putting
together a patch for it (probably just to stop processing the script
at a NUL byte), but never did as I didn't think I could put a
convincing enough case for it being *useful*.

Anyway, I'd be happy enough with the -z patch as it stands, or if
someone comes up with something better, that would suit me too...

Subject: [Python-Dev] -z, -i and -m, maybe bug in runpy?
Message-ID: <20070724004010.0E74B3A40AA@sparrow.telecommunity.com>

While trying to get my -z replacement patch to work, I stumbled 
across a bug in the -m implementation (and in runpy).  It seems that 
when you run the code of a -m module, it is *not* run in the __main__ 
module namespace!

So even though __name__=='__main__', globals() is not 
sys.modules['__main__'].__dict__.  This seems wrong to me.  Does 
anybody know why runpy doesn't actually run the code in the target module?

One consequence of this is that the -i option is much less useful 
when you use -m, because the script's globals have disappeared before 
you get to the interpreter prompt.

At this point, I've successfully gotten a -z replacement patch, 
except that it inherits this apparent bug from -m, which for a while 
led me to believe my patch was broken (when in fact it works fine, 
apart from inheriting the -m behavior).

Does anybody know if this behavior is intended, and if so, why?  And 
what are the consequences of changing/fixing it?

Subject: [Python-Dev] Two spaces or one?
Message-ID: <46A56193.6010500@acm.org>

In PEP 9 there's a requirement that PEPs must follow the "emacs 
convention" of 2 spaces after a period. (I didn't know this was an emacs 
convention, I thought it was a convention of people who used typewriters.)

I've tried hard to maintain this textual convention in my own PEPs, even 
though it's very unnatural to me. But I see from looking at the other 
PEPs that that this convention is very inconsistently enforced - some 
have it and some don't. Worse, I've had one person (who apparently 
wasn't aware of the rule) flag my use of extra space after a period as a 
bug in my PEP.

(When I first learned to type, I used one space after a period. Then 
years later, someone convinced me that two spaces was the proper style 
and so I switched to that for a few years. But later I switched back 
because I realized that most modern typographical layout engines seem to 
calculate inter-sentence spacing properly when the number of space 
characters after a period is one. And in HTML [which is how most people 
view PEPs anyway] it doesn't matter since the browser is going to filter 
out the extra space anyway.)

So if we're not going to enforce the rule consistently (and it seems as 
if we're not), can we then just remove it from PEP 9? I'm not saying 
that we should change the rule to one space, I'm suggesting that we just 
drop the requirement and let people use whatever they prefer.

Just to update everyone on the status of this, the next thing on my
list is to figure out the Windows build and set up the the file
association in the installer.  Actually, I should ask if there's
anything else that I should pay attention to here, e.g. do I have to
add an icon association for Windows or something like that?

Is there any documentation like a wiki page on this?  I looked at the
README in the PC* directories and it doesn't seem to talk about the
installer.  Maybe it will become clearer when I get Visual Studio.

New icons get added so rarely that each time it happens, Windows has
changed enough to make the instructions invalid... I do remember
creating icon associations for .py, .pyc, .pyo and .pyw, and separate
"open" associations for these. IIRC the two associations are quite
independent. Probably everything has changed though since we now use
MSI.

If the PEP is displayed as HTML, then one or two spaces after a period
in plain text might not matter; any browser that I've bothered to check
visually merges space characters unless they are intermixed/replaced
with non-breaking space (&nbsp;). If ReStructured Text converts to
non-breaking space, then they matter.

In terms of text text editing, I think that as long as one is consistant
within a document, that's good enough.

It's all in Tools/msi/msi.py. Just look for the other extensions;
the change should be fairly straight-forward.

It's an Emacs convention in the sense that its auto-filling function expects
that; it will not break lines after a period which is followed by a
single space only.
(These are the default settings, this being Emacs you can customize it.)

ZIP files *do* start with a magic number; either PK\03\04 (non-empty
archive) or PK\05\06 (empty archive). This is rather easy to notice,
as I did in the bad old days of DOS, and i recently doubly verified it
('zip'+'khexedit', and
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_%28file_format%29; I tried the
infozip website too, but it seems to be down.)

As an emacs dinosaur, I'd prefer to keep the recommendation, but I  
also acknowledge that the smaller mammals nipping at my heals will  
eventually take over the world.  I've recently had similar  
discussions in another community and I was actually kind of amazed to  
learn that auto-refilling of paragraphs itself was somewhat of an  
anachronism.

Emacs will probably go the way of the vinyl record (though the latter  
is seeing a resurgence lately :).  Changing "must" to "should" in PEP  
9 would encourage but not enforce consistency, and I think that would  
be fine.

I'm with Barry.  I still use Emacs.  Emacs's paragraph filling algorithm,
whether invoked explicitly via M-q or implicitly via auto-wrap mode,
distinguishes the usage of periods based on the number of spaces following
them.  Two or more spaces are used to separate sentences.  One space (for
example, G. D. Montanaro) following a period is considered a non-breakable
space.

After implementing the runpy explicit relative import tests over the 
last couple of days, it actually occurred to me earlier today that I 
didn't have a test for this scenario. When I thought of the test, I was 
also pretty sure it would fail - it appears I was right :)

I think it's a bug - when fiddling with the sys module 
runpy.run_module() only uses the real module name, and not the requested 
run_name. It should actually modify both so that the assertion 
"globals() is sys.modules[__name__].__dict__" is correct when running 
the module.

So, I propose that if runpy.run_module is told it has permission to 
modify the sys module, and run_name is specified and exists in 
sys.modules, then runpy will use that module to execute the code, 
instead of creating a new temporary module.

If run_name isn't in sys.modules, then the temporary module used to 
execute the code will be stored in both places.

This is a semantic change so we can't really backport it, but we can at 
least fix it for 2.6.

Cheers,
Nick.

There's no need to invoke Emacs to argue for the superiority of two
spaces after each sentence, according to this vi user.

This is Python.  We don't care much about theory, except where it intersects 
with useful practice.

OK, I've now had a closer look, and the problem isn't what I initially 
thought when I read your message (the test which I expected to fail 
actually passed without changing the current implementation). It turns 
out that while the module is actually executing it does the right thing 
- the problem only arises when the run_module function attempts to clean 
up after itself by reverting some of the changes it makes to the sys module.

The specific problem is this sentence from the run_module docs:
   "Both sys.argv[0] and sys.modules[__name__] are restored to their 
original values before the function returns."

It looks like those semantics are a mistake - the changes to the sys 
module should persist after the function terminates, leaving it to the 
calling code to decide whether or not it wants to restore the original 
state.

>> One consequence of this is that the -i option is much less useful when

See above - the problem is that the function is cleaning up after itself 
and deleting things that may still be of interest when -i is also specified.

It was intended enough to be documented that way, but I don't recall 
putting any significant thought into that aspect of the implementation, 
and nor do I remember anyone else questioning it.

The fact that it completely breaks the -i switch seems more than enough 
reason to consider it a bug, though.

I've changed the behaviour in r56520 to simply leave the alterations to 
sys in place when the function terminates. While this is a definite 
change to the interface (and hence not a candidate for direct 
backporting), I think the difference is small enough for the 2.5 to 2.6 
transition.

If enough people prefer, I can switch the code to an approach which 
fixes -m while leaving the semantics of runpy.run_module alone. This 
would involve renaming the version of run_module I just checked into SVN 
have -m invoke that version directly. run_module would be changed to 
wrap the function used by -m in the necessary code to restore the sys 
module to something more closely resembling its original state. That 
would also be the approach to take if we decided we wanted to backport 
this fix to the 2.5 maintenance branch.

Cheers,
Nick.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Calling back into python from C
Message-ID: <20070724141502.82B23600B4E@longblack.object-craft.com.au>

I realise I'm going to get slapped for asking a userish question here -
sorry in advance.  I'm looking for an explanation for why things are the
way they are, the doco and py source aren't providing the missing info,
and it looks like I'm bumping into an old Python bug (fixed in r38830
by mwh on 2005-04-18).

I'm working on an C extension that needs to call back into python.
Generally the GIL has been released when I need to do the callback,
but I can't be sure. So I need to save the GIL state, get the lock,
then restore it at the end.

As far as I can tell from the doco, the recommended way to do this is to
use PyGILState_Ensure() and PyGILState_Release(), but prior to r38830,
PyGILState_Release incorrectly used PyEval_ReleaseThread when it
should have been using PyEval_SaveThread() (I think), and the result is
SEGV. This poses a problem, as I need to support Python versions back
to 2.3.

Am I correct in using PyGILState_Ensure() and PyGILState_Release()? If
so, how do I support back to Py 2.3? Copy the current fixed
PyGILState_Release() into my code (ick)?

Subject: [Python-Dev] Failure on assorted buildbots - Address already in use
Message-ID: <46A6105A.10908@gmail.com>

A lot of the buildbots are red at the moment, which makes it harder to 
tell if a checkin broke anything new on other platforms.

I've checked in a change to test_resource that should hopefully make 
some of the Debian buildbots happier, but several of the other buildbots 
are reporting a variety of "Address already in use" errors in the 
subthreads created by test_urllib2.

Anyone have any ideas?

I made this argument in private to Talin before he went here for a
second opinion. Apparently it wasn't strong enough. :-)

Indeed. After all, we're talking about PEP 9, which is a *plaintext*
format. Check out http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0009/ and you'll
see that it is rendered in a fixed-width font with line breaks exactly
where they are in the source, and the two spaces make a difference for
readability.

How about in PEP 9 we keep the recommendation, perhaps weakened to
"should" or "ought"; but in PEP 12 (the ReST equivalent) we remove it
altogether because it doesn't affect the rendering.

And let's please not make this into a bikeshed discussion than it already is.

Test pass ok in my machine.

However, if in another terminal I make...

>>> import socket
>>> s = socket.socket()
>>> s.bind(("127.0.0.1", 8080))

...the test fails exactly like in the buildbot.

Maybe the tests should be changed to use a not-so-standard port.

Message-ID: <e7ba66e40707240909o5e5d617fl19a64b582a74c1e9@mail.gmail.com>

I'm porting some of my code to py3k, and I started from the C size.
After this, all extensions compiled fine, but after a 'setup.py
install', I got the following:

  File "/usr/local/python/3.0/lib/python3.0/distutils/util.py", line
498, in byte_compile
    compile(file, cfile, dfile)
  File "/usr/local/python/3.0/lib/python3.0/py_compile.py", line 127, in compile
    py_exc = PyCompileError(err.__class__,err.args,dfile or file)
  File "/usr/local/python/3.0/lib/python3.0/py_compile.py", line 48, in __init__
    tbtext = ''.join(traceback.format_exception_only(exc_type, exc_value))

in format_exception_only
    lines.append("%s: %s\n" % (stype, str(msg)))
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'msg' referenced before assignment


At this point, I had not updated my python code, so it surelly had
some py3k-invalid things. Looking at 'traceback.py', it seems there is
something wrong in 'format_exception_only', so this error.

Doubt it.  Even as we speak, there's probably a student planning to

You can believe that, but it's not the whole story. You can *prepend*
arbitrary data and the zip tools can still read the archive.

Your fix is a definite improvement for me, my "run any importable" 
patch is looking a lot better.  There's just one problem left, which 
is that runpy is overwriting sys.argv[0] even if it doesn't need 
to.  So, when running from a zipfile, sys.argv[0] ends up None, which 
is wrong.

However, if I ask runpy not to mess with sys, it creates a new module 
namespace to run the code in, bringing me right back to square one 
(i.e., not being run in __main__).  Any thoughts?

My fallback at this point would be to add an option to run_module() 
to request that sys.argv[0] be used in place of calling 
_get_filename().  It seems ugly to do that, though, if only because 
there are already so many arguments to that function.

Yes, range() on the p3yk branch seems broken. However, this bug has
been fixed in the py3k-struni, the branch where most the development
for Python 3000 is taking place.

Yeah, that particular test is not yet working. (Fixes are welcome --
see http://wiki.python.org/moin/Py3kStrUniTests for how to help.)

I believe I rigged "make install" to continue after this error -- did
the rest of the install complete?

FWIW, a better place to discuss Py3k bleeding edge stuff is
python-3000 at python.org. Sign up at the usual place. (I've CC'ed that

Or use port 0 to let the operating system pick a free port:

    >>> import socket
    >>> s = socket.socket()
    >>> s.bind(("127.0.0.1", 0))
    >>> s.getsockname()

Adding a get_filename() method to ZipImporter objects would get you 
something better than None in sys.argv[0] (specifically, you would see 
<zipfile_name>/__main__.py)

For a reason I mentioned below, another idea I've had is to tweak the 
run_module semantics again and state that if __name__ already exists in 
sys.modules, then the code will be executed in the existing module, 
rather than in a new module (regardless of the value of the alter_sys 
argument).

This would mean that the -m switch would always use the builtin __main__ 
module, instead of creating a new module the way it does now. This would 
not only fix your current problem, but also avoid any potential issues 
associated with having sys.modules["__main__"] refer to a different 
module while the interpreter is starting up (e.g. while running 
sitecustomize.py, and while doing any package imports needed to locate 
the module to be executed).

I'm actually becoming more and more in favour of reverting run_module 
back to its 2.5 semantics and adding a separate function that does the 
right thing for the -m switch. It is really starting to look like the 
useful behaviour for a module namespace based execfile equivalent and 
the -m switch aren't as closely aligned as I thought they were back when 
I wrote PEP 338.

Cheers,
Nick.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Terminology of "Iterable" and "Iterator"
Message-ID: <76fd5acf0707250518s690ab16dh13bda96abd5d738b@mail.gmail.com>

I got into a discussion about this, which made me think it would make
sense to formalize a distinction between "iterable" and "iterator". To
nearly any python developer I talk with, we can define them as:

iterable - An object which can be passed to the built-in iter()
function, which returns an iterator.

iterator - An object with a .next() method, which is used to invoke
the iteration. An iterator _should_ also be an iterable, and will
nearly always return itself as its own iterator.

Now, the current documentation makes no distinction, and we see this
in the docstring for iter(), which is curious:

    iter(collection) -> iterator

This might indicate that it is using "collection" where I would say
"iterable". Also, the same docstring makes mention of something being
an iterator _or_ a sequence, so I also should bring up that it may be
antiquated, yes?

http://docs.python.org/dev/lib/typeiter.html

That page describes the same two categories you do, but doesn't actually 
use the word 'iterable' for the first category (i.e. anything with an 
__iter__ method).

So, yes, I think updating the docs to use the common terminology for 
both categories would be a good thing.

Cheers,
Nick.

I've changed test_urllib2_localnet to work this way - we'll see if it

Yep, looks like that did the trick. Facundo, a similar change may help 
with the GSoC project you're mentoring (the new smtplib tests failed on 
at least one of the buildbots).

The docs do make a distinction and generally follow the definitions given in the glossary for the tuturial.

In the case of iter(collection), I prefer the current wording because the target object need not support __iter__, it is sufficient 
to supply a sequential __getitem__ method.

That's not the goal, actually; I want runpy to leave sys.argv[0] 
alone, so that we maintain the invariant that invoking sys.executable 
with sys.argv will re-run the same effective program.  (And pointing 
to __main__.py inside the zipfile won't work!)

+1; just make sure it has a way to request *not* overwriting sys.argv[0].

But as "collection" is never used in that meaning anywhere else, it could
as well be iter(object).

Seems to me that should be included in the definition of
an iterable -- i.e. anything for which iter() works is
an iterable.

The term "French Spacing" is used for two spaces after a period ending
a sentence, for those wishing to do more research.  I have not found
any authoritative answer.  The balance has been towards two spaces
when using a monospaced font.

That points towards a way forward.  Why do programming languages
continue to assume use of a monospaced font?  It was natural when we
used punch cards and line printers, but now?  Python relies on the
indentation but could be flexible about other textual attributes.

Nothing in Python assumes anything about fonts.  That's all a function of
the text editor you use and your editing preferences.  Me, I find it easier
to read code which is displayed or printed with monospaced fonts.  Note,
however, that I've been programming for 30 years.  I started with IBM punch
cards, so I might be a bit biased.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Floating point test_pow failure on the alpha Debian
	buildbot
Message-ID: <46A8AADE.7080506@gmail.com>

test_pow is failing on the alpha Debian buildbot, complaining that a 
negative number can't be raised to a fractional power. Now, to work 
around some bugs in platform implementations of math.fpow(), pow() does 
its own check to see if the exponent is an integer.

The way pow() does that check is to try "iw == floor(iw)", so to see why 
the exception was being triggered, I put a couple of extra output lines 
into the test and got:

*** Number: 1.2299999999999999e+167
*** Floor: 1.2299999999999997e+167

Given that the magnitude of the exponent significantly exceeds the 
precision of an IEEE double, it seems wrong for floor() to be changing 
the mantissa like that (and, on my machine, and all of the other 
buildbots, it doesn't).

I've added an explicit test for this misbehaviour to test_math so at 
least the buildbot gives a clearer indication of what's going wrong, but 
I'm not sure what to do with it beyond that.

Cheers,
Nick.

I started in '98, and I also find monospaced fonts easier to read in
various circumstances (email, code, shells, etc.).  But indeed, Python
makes no assumption about fonts.  A person could use Wingdings for all
Python cares.

It is wrong -- the machine representation of test_pow's 1.23e167
literal is an exact integer on any current box, and the floor of any
exact integer is the integer itself.

This isn't Python's problem -- a bug report should be opened against
the platform C's implementation of floor(), and the test /should/ fail
in Python so long as the platform floor() remains broken.

This phrase sounded to me like one of the slurs the English invented
during their various wars with the Dutch and the French (e.g. "Dutch
courage"), so I looked into it a bit.

The practice of double-spacing after a period was standard even with
proportional fonts before the advent of the Linotype machine, the
mechanical design of which didn't accommodate it.

See http://webword.com/reports/period.html.

``If the [Linotype machine] operator typed two spaces in a row, you
had two wedges next to each other, and that tended to gum up the
operation.  Clients who insisted could be accommodated by typing an
en-space followed by a justifier-space, but printers charged extra for
it and ridiculed it as 'French Spacing, oo-la-la, you want it all
fancy, huh? Well it'll cost ya, bub, and plenty too...' and soon it
became unfashionable in the US.''

Though being notably younger ;), I couldn't live without monospaced fonts for
source code.  Apart from being easier to read, it is essential for sketches
or things that must be aligned, such as the class schema in SocketServer.py.

However, I've got in my unittests (running with py3k)

I am not completelly sure if this is expected (it is, regarding

I post this for your consideration.

Yes, this is expected. By an assignment to range anywhere in a function
scope, the name is marked as a local and won't ever be looked up in the
global namespace.

I'd move the range = xrange part at the module top, or just bring the 2.x
version in a state where one run of 2to3 produces a working 3.0 version.

HTH,
Georg

Programming *languages* don't -- I know of no
(serious[1]) language that requires a monospaced font
in order to work correctly. Even in Python, as long
as you don't mix tabs and spaces, indentation still
works since it's all at the beginning of a line.

Certain *conventions* sometimes used by programmers
might require it, but that's a different thing.

[1] Brainf**k is an obvious exception.

I normally use monospaced fonts for Python, but in my
Think Pascal days I wrote most of my Pascal in Geneva.
I thought it actually looked quite nice that way,
especially with TP's auto-formatting.

It depends a lot on the font, though -- I don't think
I'd like to program in Times, for instance.

This just goes to show we're living in the dark
ages wrt source code representation. We should
be able to write our comments in HTML with
embedded SVG diagrams. :-)

It'll probably be called Microsoft Visual Presentation and

I had to read that sentence twice to understand that
you didn't actually go to Switzerland to write Pascal
(although this would have been very appropriate).

Subject: [Python-Dev] Bus error in transformer.py
Message-ID: <46AB245B.9050002@gafol.net>

Hi!

I'm still working on bug:
http://python.org/sf/1720241

First thing I've found is that `compile` works OK, but `compiler.parse` not.
And I feel that It's bug in python, or python port, because I'm getting 
Bus error
on some stage when I'm tracing execution and trying to backtrace. Also 
`parser.expr`
passes ok, and error raises in Transformer class.
 
I've attached part of the debugger session, and script I use.

Any hints how to debug it further?

Have you run it under control of a C-level debugger (gdb, dbx, etc) to see
where the bus error occurs?

You should run it under gdb, or attach to the interpreter
from gdb.

Could it be that you get a stack overflow? To my knowledge,
stack space is very scarce on FreeBSD if you use threads.

Martin

I've run it with gdb before (when posted  a bug),
and sometimes I got a huge traceback with
10000+ lines and sometimes less than 100
full of question marks so I've decided it's not of
a great interest. Today I've got quite good
backtrace :)

Well, yes it is!

I've tested stack overflow before without using threads,
and it throws an exception as expected.

But this:
  def test():
      test()

  from threading import Thread
  t = Thread(target = test)
  t.start()
  t.join()
Produces "Segmentation fault" on python2.4 and "Bus error" on
python2.5.

Following line:
  threading.stack_size(1<<19)
Fixes this problem for python2.5.

Thanks a lot. I think I'll set up it in sitecustomize.py.
I don't know but maybe you should consider change platform defaults.

Such a patch should be contributed by a FreeBSD expert. Different
versions of FreeBSD behave differently, with too many conditions to
consider. It's a mess. The simplest thing to do would be to stop
supporting threading on FreeBSD.

Martin

I didn't find any reply to this, which is odd, so forgive me if it's
old news.

I agree with you that it's not thread safe and that a local buffer in
the stack should fix it.

Just for reference, the thread-safe uuid extension we've been using
since python 2.1, which I don't recall where we borrow it from, uses a
local buffer in the stack.  It looks like this:

-----begin uuid.c--------------

static char uuid__doc__ [] =
"DCE compatible Universally Unique Identifier module";

#include "Python.h"
#include <uuid/uuid.h>

static char uuidgen__doc__ [] =
"Create a new DCE compatible UUID value";

static PyObject *
uuidgen(void)
{
uuid_t out;
char buf[48];

    uuid_generate(out);
    uuid_unparse(out, buf);
    return PyString_FromString(buf);
}

static PyMethodDef uuid_methods[] = {
    {"uuidgen", uuidgen, 0, uuidgen__doc__},
    {NULL,      NULL}        /* Sentinel */
};

DL_EXPORT(void)
inituuid(void)
{
    Py_InitModule4("uuid",
               uuid_methods,
               uuid__doc__,
               (PyObject *)NULL,
               PYTHON_API_VERSION);
}

-----end uuid.c--------------


It also seems that using uuid_generate()/uuid_unparse() should be
faster than using uuid_generate_random() and then creating a python
object to call its __str__ method.  If so, it would be nice if the
uuid.py module also provided equivalent fast versions that returned
strings instead of objects.

Hasan,

We made a change to bind the server to port 0, so that an unused port
is selected for each test.  I wasn't able to reproduce the failure
after making this change; is the current trunk still failing for you?

Cheers,
Alan

Subject: [Python-Dev] Cygwin: Problem detecting subprocess termination after
 _spawn_posix in distutils?
Message-ID: <f8lcd3$9ou$1@sea.gmane.org>

I've been trying to install PIL 1.1.6 for several days now under Cygwin. 
I have tried the Cygwin, Image and distutils lists with nary a pointer, 
so I wondered whether python-dev might lead me to an answer (other than 
"Stop using Cygwin" ;-)

Here's the output from a failed setup run with a couple of debug prints 
inserted which should report how sub-process termination occurred - it 
hangs after this output.

$ python setup.py build
running build
running build_py
running build_ext
building '_imaging' extension
SPAWN: ['gcc', '-fno-strict-aliasing', '-DNDEBUG', '-g', '-O3', '-Wall', 
'-Wstrict-prototypes', '-DHAVE_LIBZ', '-IlibImaging', '-I/usr/include', 
'-I/usr/include/python2.5', '-c', 'libImaging/Chops.c', '-o', 
'build/temp.cygwin-1.5.24-i686-2.5/libImaging/Chops.o'] PATH? 1 V: 0 D:0
gcc -fno-strict-aliasing -DNDEBUG -g -O3 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes 
-DHAVE_LIBZ -IlibImaging -I/usr/include -I/usr/include/python2.5 -c 
libImaging/Chops.c -o build/temp.cygwin-1.5.24-i686-2.5/libImaging/Chops.o
Are we done yet? Waiting on pid 3280

I have to kill a python.exe process that's left running in the 
background if I CTRL/C the build. Otherwise it will spend all night in a 
tight loop. The compilation is finished when I kill the process, and the 
next compile will begin if I repeat the command.

I extracted the _spawn_all function from distutils/spawn.py, hacked some 
exceptions and ran it under command line control.

That worked fine with other subtasks, so I wondered whether this was a 
failure specific to gcc, which would seem kind of unlikely. I ran the 
same compile using my test function standing alone, seeing success:

sholden at bigboy ~/Imaging-1.1.6
$ python ~/Projects/Python/spawntest.py gcc -fno-strict-aliasing 
-DNDEBUG -g -O3 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -DHAVE_LIBZ -IlibImaging 
-I/usr/include -I/usr/include/python2.5 -c libImaging/Chops.c -o 
build/temp.cygwin-1.5.24-i686-2.5/libImaging/Chops.o
Are we done yet? Waiting on pid 3244
Got pid, status 3244 0
Got WIFEXITED 0

So it appears unlikely to be gcc-specific, leaving me wondering what 
exactly is the difference between the build environment and my tests.

It would be really nice if test_distutils showed any failures, but it 
doesn't so any assistance would be welcome. At this point I can't even 
replicate the failure in a simpler test :-(

regards
  Steve

Why is boolean support needed, given that optparse has store_true and
store_false actions?  Example usage:

    parser.add_option('--confirm', action='store_true', dest='confirm')

--amk

So you can do:
--option=false

Otherwise you have to do something like:
(action='store_false', default=True)

and use:
--no-option

which is OK sometimes, but why not allow a choice?

HI all,

I am using python v2.5 and I am an amateur working on python. I am extending
python for my research work and would like some help and guidance w.r.t this
matter from you experienced python developers.

II want to add some more KEYWORDS and DATATYPES into the python script apart
from the existing ones.

It would be really great if anybody could guide me as which files and
modules I need to look to make these additions and enhancements to the
existing python version. Thanks a lot in advance and your help is really
appreciated.

python-dev is probably not the right place for this discussion.  You have
three good options:

* If you want to propose new keywords and types to get included into the
base language, you should use the python-ideas list.

* If you're doing this for yourself, use comp.lang.python or the capi-sig
list.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Python Package Index hostname change
Message-ID: <46AFA27A.4090700@v.loewis.de>

The Python Packaging Index (the software formerly known
as Cheeseshop) is now available at

http://pypi.python.org/pypi

The old addresses (www.python.org/pypi, and
cheeseshop.python.org/pypi) will continue to work,
either as aliases or using HTTP redirections.

The software was renamed to its old name
(PyPI - Python Package Index), as the Cheeseshop
name was ever confusing people unfamiliar with
British television comedy sketch (and puzzling
even to people familiar with the sketch, as
you *can* get packages from the package index).

If you would like to discuss PyPI and its future,
please join catalog-sig at python.org.

In addition to what Aahz said: take a look at PEP 306 for adding
keywords. If you don't understand it, *don't* ask here, but on
comp.lang.python instead.

For adding new datatypes, look at xxmodule.c. The same disclaimer
applies: if you have any questions about that, don't ask here.

My guess is that it's the environment; if not that, the working
directory. Assuming you have already instrumented
ccompiler.CCompiler.spawn, I suggest to dump os.environ and
print os.getcwd(). Assuming you really meant that you run under
Cygwin Python (instead of just using --compiler), you might
want to instrument spawn._spawn_posix instead.

When you say you extracted _spawn_all from distutils/spawn.py:
what version of Python are you talking about? I can't find
_spawn_all in the sources of 2.5.x, or 2.6.

Folklore that I remember so unreliably I avoid trying to repeat it here
held that Python threading had problems on BSD and allied Unixes.  What's
the status of this?  I suspect the answer is, "Everything works, and the
only real problem ever was that *signals* have different semantics under
Linux and *BSD."  Anyone who can answer explicitly, though, would repre-
sent a help to me.

Python thinnks range is local, because you referenced it, even if an
error ocurred. Use 'global range' at the top of the file.

But, as I understand, you are trying to target both Python 2.x and 3
with the same code, using tricks like this one. I think that, even if
you succeed, the resulting code will be quite unmaintainable.
