While I haven't been visible much lately, especially in the 3.0 space,
I do have plans to continue supporting the OS/2 EMX environment (PC/os2emx).

For 3.x, the PC/os2vacpp subdirectory can go, as I don't expect to be
able to support the VAC++ toolchain.

I have now studied this in detail, and fixed it in Python's trunk;
see the tracker item for details.

In short:
- IDLE redirects all widget sub-commands, either calling an overridden
  definition, or the original Tk command.
- in the redirection of "bbox", Tk 8.4 would return a string, whereas
  8.5 now returns a list.
- _tkinter converts the string to a Python string, and the list to a
  Python tuple
- IDLE returns the Python value to _tkinter, which in turn converts
  it to a string. This leaves the 8.4 string unchanged, but converts
  the 8.5 tuple into something like "(10, 10, 20, 20)".
- Tk interprets it as a list of numbers, choking as "(10," is not
  a meaningful number.

The fix is to return an ObjResult to Tcl from a Python callback.
I'm skeptical about back-porting this to 2.5, as it may affect behavior.
So for 2.5, we probably have to recommend not using Tk 8.5.

There are a number of additional incompatible changes. For example,
text::index returns textindex objects now, where it used to return
strings. I have fixed that in Tkinter, which converts the textindex
back to a string. I'm sure there are other places where Tk 8.5 will
break existing Tkinter applications.

The standard library, my personal code, third-party packages, and my employer's code base are filled with examples of the following pattern:

try:
   import threading

   import dummy_threading as threading

try:
    import xml.etree.cElementTree as ET

    try:

try:

How about a new, simpler syntax:

* import threading or dummy_threading as threading

* import xml.etree.CElementTree or cElementTree or elementree.ElementTree as ET

* from cStringIO or StringIO import StringIO

* import readline or emptymodule

These all look good to me.  The "short circuit" import syntax and
semantics are compact and intuitive.

> * import readline or emptymodule

This I find more problematic as "emptymodule" seems too magical.  Even
now any code that wants to use a module that might not have been
successfully imported needs to check if that's the case.  E.g., a
fuller current use-case would be:

try:
   readline = None
   import readline
except ImportError:
   pass

if readline is not None:
   readline.foo()
   ...

Conceivably emptymodule could act as a Null object but that could
create more problems than it solves.

I wonder if your perceived need for this isn't skewed by your working
within the core?

Also, in 3.0 many of the use cases should go away -- e.g. cStringIO
vs, StringIO, etc., as we switch the stdlib to having a single
"public" name for an API which automatically replaces or augments
itself with the accelerated C version if available.

My gut reaction is -0.  For starters, many of these should go away with
Python 3.0 (e.g. cStringIO).  Also, annoying as the try/except is, I
think the fact that it signals the special import is helpful; your
suggestion is too light-weight IMO.  If you could devise something just
a bit heavier, that would be much better.

How about

import readline or None as readline

This is just for cases where you don't want to trigger ImportException on
import and do want the symbol set to None for later testing. A standalone
"import None" could have no effect.

The need was perceived by a colleague who does not work on the core.  My own skew was in the opposite direction -- I've seen the pattern so often that I'm oblivious to it.

Before posting, I ran some scans of our code base at work and found plenty of examples (mostly third-party cmodules vs python equivalents and a few that searched for similar functionality in different packages).  It might be helpful if others were to also search their own code bases and post their findings:

  find . -name "*py" | xargs grep -C2 ImportError *py

Also, Google's codesearch gives some examples (and a lot of cases that really do need the try/except form):

  http://www.google.com/codesearch?q=+lang:python+%22except+ImportError%22

I was surprised to see many examples in the form of:

  try:
      import xyz
  except ImportError:
      xyz = None

I was also surprised to find plenty of code that is likely to be buggy because the two alternative loaded different names:

  try:
      from Products.OpenPT.OpenPTFile import OpenPTFile as ptFile
  except ImportError:
      from Products.PageTemplates.PageTemplateFile import PageTemplateFile

I was not surprised to see searches for similar functionality across different packages like kjbuckets vs kjbuckets0 , Zope vs Zope2, or HTMLParser vs SGMLParser, or attempts to  load any of several packages compliant with the DBAPI.

Surely, Py3.0's automatic vectoring to C equivalent modules will help with the cases like cStringIO, cPickle.  I don't think it will help with the general case of searching for a best available package (like gdbm vs dbm vs dumbdbm or threading vs dummythreading) or a best available implementation of a single function (like twisted.protocols._c_urlarg.unquote vs urllib.unquote or one of the various implementations of date utilities or encryption functions).

Am curious to see what everyone else finds in their own code searches.

Perhaps "import readline or None" would have been a better way to capture that pattern as well as the "except pass" pattern.

I'm sympathetic to this syntax proposal, as I find the repetition and
extra lines for a simple idea to be a little unpleasant. This would
also allow us to decide whether the import 'or' handling would be
triggered equivalently to the except ImportError case you described,
or only for missing imports. The latter would stop errors in existing
modules from being silenced (and may give reason to allow emptymodule
or None), but I'm unsure if that's a good thing.

Of the above I find the ElementTree migration to be the most
compelling, yet it seems ill-timed to bring syntax into Python 2.x
you'd be unable to use until you no longer needed it. However your
later example of the PageTemplateFile, which appears to be due to a
third-party module reorganization and could certainly happen during
the lifetime of late 2.x, helps swing me back the other way.

Message-ID: <5d44f72f0801022352x1845d0e2yce0ff3edba1985b2@mail.gmail.com>

I've been backporting pep 3141 to the trunk, and ran into the issue
that round, math.floor, and math.ceil, which it specifies to return
Integrals, currently return floats. Guido suggested privately that, to
make sure that 2.6 is compatible with 2.5, they should keep returning
floats for float arguments. Probably this implies that they should
also keep returning float for int and long arguments.

For other types, we're probably free to do whatever. Consistency
across all Real implementations suggests that those 3 functions should
always return their argument type. Consistency and compatibility with
3.0 suggest that they should return long for every new type we add
them to. What does the list think?

Thanks,

I think Py2.6 and Py2.5 should be treated with more respect.  Will backporting this change can only cause relief or create 
headaches?.   By definition, the Py3.0 release was supposed to be the one big incompatible set of changes.  Backporting with a goal 
of "consistency and compatibility with 3.0" suggests that the backporters may have lost their compass.

FWIW, Py2.6 hasn't been released yet and no one *has* to upgrade to it.  So, if it is to have any chance of success, it needs to be 
a better Python than 2.5.  IMO, jamming 3.0 junk into 2.x just provides an incentive to skip the upgrade altogether.  In the press 
release for 2.6, we need to be able to say something stronger than:  filled with deprecations, two ways to do everything, dozens of 
tiny incompatibilities all done in the name of 3.0, and runs slower.

I think there ought to be a much more agressive standard for 3.0 backports:, "does the proposed backport make 2.6 more attractive?" 
Remember, for large code bases, upgrading is a PITA (I think Google is still running tons of code on 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4).  There 
needs to be a good incentive for upgrading; otherwise, Py2.6 *will* fail.

The specific change suggested here is possibly (and perhaps probably) harmless; however, it is part of a larger trend that is not 
healthy for the 2.x series.

These are some of the examples, I've tried to reduce them to specific use
patterns:

To determine if some feature is available:
try:
    pygments = __import__('pygments', {}, {}, [])
    have_pygments = True
except ImportError:
    have_pygments = False

try:
    from docutils import nodes
    from docutils.core import publish_parts
    from docutils.parsers import rst
    from docutils import __version__
except ImportError:
    raise TracError(_('Docutils not found'))
if StrictVersion(__version__) < StrictVersion('0.3.9'):
    raise TracError(_('Docutils version >= %(version)s required, '
                      '%(found)s found', version='0.3.9', found=__version__))

To specify which specific version we have of a given module:
try:
    import pysqlite2.dbapi2 as sqlite
    have_pysqlite = 2
except ImportError:
    try:
        import sqlite3 as sqlite
        have_pysqlite = 2
    except ImportError:

            return getattr(obj, name)

            return obj[name]
        return _getitem

Well, as issue 1689 states, the backporting was commited by Jeffrey on
rev 5967 [2], so this is the time to understand if we want this or
not.

Personally, I'm -0.

I was involved in this because of Decimal, but I can grow some
__methods__ in it that can be in the trunk, unused, and when ported to
3k fit ok in the new infrastructure.

The syntax idea has a nice ring to it, except for the last idea. As
others have already said, the name emptymodule is too magic.

The readline example becomes more readable when you change the import to

import readline or None as readline


In my opinion the import or as syntax definition is easy to understand
if you force the user to always have an "as" statement. The None name is
optional but must be the last name:

import name[, or name2[, or name3 ...] [, or None] as target

This translates into:

try:
    import name as target
except ImportError:
    try:
        import name2 as target
    except ImportError:
        target = None

from name[, or name2 ...] [, or None] import target

translates into

try:
    from name import target
except ImportError:
    try:
        from name2 import target
    except ImportError:
        target = None

Wouldn't a (stdlib) function suffice in the cases where this is needed?

ET = import_with_alternative("xml.etree.CElementTree", "cElementTree",  
"elementtree.ElementTree")

It's not as elegant, but it's easier than status quo.

I don't think it's as visually clear, but that may be I'm just not used to it.


An alternative possibility might be, rather than "or", reuse "else" before 
import.

import threading
else import dummy_threading as threading

import xml.etree.CElementTree as ET
else import cElementTree as ET
else import elementtree.ElementTree as ET



The readline example above should be in a try except as it allows a failure 
to pass.  For example if you wanted to allow the above elementtree example 
to pass instead of raising an exception you would write..

try:
     import xml.etree.CElementTree as ET
     else import cElementTree as ET
     else import elementtree.ElementTree as ET
except ImportError:
     pass              # or handle failed import.

This still improves readability and flattens out the multiple nested 
structure which I believe is what makes the current way unappealing.


I think multiple possible imports in "from - import"s statements should not 
be allowed.  When you consider multiple imports from possibly multiple 
sources, it seems like that could get a bit messy when debugging.

    Ron

Very well put, Raymond.

I wonder, though, whether the appearance of a viable 3.0 will
essentially kill the demand for 2.6?

Whoa. Jeffrey is mostly backporting new stuff (such as numbers.py)
which doesn't introduce incompatibilities. The backporting is intended
to make 2.6 more attractive by allowing developers to do some of the
painful work of porting to 3.0 while staying on 2.6.

Watch your words, Raymond. I don't mind personally, but you run the
risk of discouraging contributors by slamming down on them with with
words like "jamming 3.0 junk into 2.x", and that's the last thing we
want to happen. We're thin on contributors as it is (have you noticed
how few people are submitting anything at all lately?).

2.6 should be extremely compatible with 2.5 by default. Its main
attraction should be that it is an important stepping stone in the
upgrade path from 2.{2,3,4,5} to 3.0 -- going straight from 2.5 to 3.0
will be much harder than going from 2.5 to 2.6, doing a bunch of work
while on 2.6, and then going to 3.0. The initial step from 2.5 to 2.6
should be very simple and painless.

There will still be plenty of good stuff in 2.6 to encourage folks to
upgrade who have no need for 3.0 (yet) -- this is the backported 3.0
stuff that doesn't create incompatibilities (like abc.py and
numbers.py).

The incentive for upgrading will be "you can reach 3.0 easier via 2.6"
and perhaps "the latest version of 3rd party software X runs best on
2.6".

Where do you see evidence for a larger trend? I agree that a trend
towards making 2.6 less compatible with 2.5 would be a mistake, but I
don't think I see it happening.

This is a problem. Right now, in the trunk, math.float(1) returns 1,
where it should return 1.0 for compatibility with 2.5. Jeffrey, can
you fix this and similar incompatibilities you introduced?

When you say this are you talking about code or contributions all over the
project, e.g. documentation?

Is there a reason that it thinned out?

I'm asking since I never really dove into the Python project much aside from
using Python here and there, but I seem to get a career using Python almost
full-time so perhaps there are things I, and I am sure others, can step up to
help out.

We're getting a fair number of doc contributions, especially since the
docs were converted from Latex to ReST, and especially since the start
of the GHOP project.

My main gripe is with code contributions to Py3k and 2.6; Py3k is
mostly done by a handful of people, and almost nobody is working much
on 2.6.

With the minor modification of changing emptymodule by a None in the
last line, I'm +0 on it.

I don't use this that much, but I find this syntax clear and
understable. It does not bring additional complexity when not used,
and is very helpful when needed.

Don't know how much effort for the parser it is, though.

I prefer "else" to "or" but with the original single-statement syntax.

If the last clause could be an expression as well as a module name, what
I've done (used with and copied from BeautifulSoup):

    try:
        from htmlentitydefs import name2codepoint
    except ImportError:
        name2codepoint = {}

could become:

    from htmlentitydefs else ({}) import name2codepoint as name2codepoint

Also:

    import foo or (None) as foo

What needs to be done with 2.6?  I'm happy to review patches, although

Incidentally, I'm planning to set up an SVK repos containing the GHOP

don't know if repository proliferation is a generally good idea ;).

We have 109 patches open for 2.5 [1], and 118 patches open for 2.6 [2].

Note that the added number is less than the sum, as some patchs are
marked for both versions, and even some are marked as 3.0 also. And of
course I'm not counting bugs, here, just issues marked as patch.

I deliberately work only on the trunk (except for some issues
regarding Decimal), because of the balance Guido talked about.

For those of us still using Python 2.4 and earlier, it's hard to be  
motivated to worry about Python 3.0, no matter how wonderful it  
looks.  (It doesn't help that my own available time appears to  
decrease daily with the kids and all.)

Python 2.6 seems to be entirely targeted at people who really want to  
be on Python 3, but have code that will need to be ported.  I  
certainly don't view it as interesting in it's own right.

The question is, is reviewing patches a good place to contribute?  Also,
if I (and others) could have a "core mentor" with commit access, that
might streamline things.  As it is, I am worried that patch reviews will
pass through the ether without leaving a visible trace; that's OK and
understandable, but it's demotivating.

(I've had a very good experience with Georg and documentation commits
for GHOP.)

3k and 26 are, however, the only place where we can propose new features

You don't put the bar high for newbies on the Python project eh? :)

I am assumign that most of those contributions code-wise need a fair amount of
knowledge of Python's internals?

There's a great Duke Ellington quote: ``Without a deadline, baby, I
wouldn't do nothing.''

The SSL code in 2.6 is out-of-date (buggy) compared to the code in the
3.x branch, for instance.  I just haven't prioritized backporting the
3.x fixes, because there's no schedule for 2.6.

Titus,

Having a "core mentor" would be great but do they really have time for
that?  I've been lucky at finding people in #python / #python-dev) that can
answer development inquiries (or at least verify something is or is not a
bug).

With respects to the bug tracker, when I select Search and Python 2.6, I
retrieved 208 open bugs.  At a quick glance, I found two that were windows,
but not tagged appropriately.  If it's worthwhile, I can spend some time
this evening browsing the list of current 2.6 bugs to see if there are any
duplicates, collisions, etc.

It's neither impossible nor too hard to get involved. I got from
"haven't done serious C coding in years" to "Python core developer with
full svn access" in less than 9 months. OK, I've more than 5 years of
Python experience but you don't need it to contribute.

You can start by updating or enhancing the existing documentation,
writing new docs and tutorials or updating the unit test suite. New
tests need to be written and existing test should be ported to the new
unit test module.

Large parts of Python are written *in* Python. You don't need to be a C
coder to contribute. For example you can give a C coder a hand by
writing documentation and unit tests for the C coder. This way the C
coder can concentrate on the C code and you can enhance your unit
testing Fu. :)

IMO the main issue with 2.6 is not handling bugs and patches but
backporting 3.0 stuff. There's a spreadsheet somewhere that shows
there's a huge amount of work to be done:
http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pCKY4oaXnT81FrGo3ShGHGg (if you
can't access it, try the published version:
http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pCKY4oaXnT81FrGo3ShGHGg )

IMO patches should just be applied to the trunk ASAP.

The bulk of the *language* changes in 2.6 are driven by 3.0, but the
abstract base class support is fairly significant even if you don't
plan on going to 3.0.

There are a fair number of new features in the library: Bill's new SSL
code, collections.namedtuple, the signal handling/event loop fix, the
new floating point features dealing with infinities and NaNs.  None
are earth-shattering to me personally, but for the right audience they
might be very compelling.

So far I view 2.6 as a relatively cautious release, like 2.3.  (That
assessment may change once I research the numeric changes that just
went in.)  Most of the action has been in the surrounding tools, like
the new documentation format and the adoption of Roundup.

The bug tracker is an issue and in my opinion a development hindrance,
too. It contains almost 1,400 bugs, about 450 w/o a target version and
about 400 more bugs with a target version <= 2.4.

The bug tracker was discussed two threads "Bug tracker: meaning of
resolution keywords" and "1324 bugs in the tracker" lately. I don't want
to repeat the arguments here but Brett's answer
http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.devel/90137 is worth reading.

It will be though -- it will have genuine new features -- yes,
backported from 3.0, but new features nevertheless, and in a
compatible fashion.

Keep posting to this list, if you think a patch can be accepted.

If you think a patch should be rejected, it would probably be easiest
if you just close it.

You can only find out what feedback you get on code reviews when you
actually start reviewing :-)

I would like to promise guaranteed responses to you, but I feel that
recently, I found that I cannot keep up with such promises. But I would
hope that some of the active committers will "quickly" commit patches
when they find that your review leaves nothing to be added.

Actually, it goes all over the place. Some things (like doing "-3"
warnings for uses of .keys() that assume the result is a list)
required wizard level knowledge; other things are fairly simple. For
example, abc.py and _abcoll.py were backported successfully by someone
who was learning on the job. Backporting pure Python code often isn't
that hard.

Good to hear that is still a primary goal.  Along the way, I worried that that sentiment had been lost and that little incompatibilities were sneaking in (iirc, the proposed transition plan for leading zeroes was headed down this path).

Does the 2to3 tool work from 2.5 or from 2.6 or does it make difference?  If it works from 2.5, I'm thinking my company will make the jump all at once (after the 3.x series stabilizes, gets optimized, and key third-party packages have been migrated).  

I'm also expecting that some chuck of users will be left in the 2.x world and that they would like highest version to be as clean as possible (with migration features going into the category of things that don't provide them any benefit).

Eh? PEP 3000 has a schedule that includes 2.6:

* August 2007: release 3.0a1.
* December 2007: release 3.0a2.
* Early 2007 (pre-PyCon): release 2.6a1.
* May 2008 (post-PyCon): full feature freeze for 3.0 and 2.6.
* July 2008: release 2.6 (final).
* August 2008: release 3.0 (final).

It's not guaranteed that it will work from 2.5. The transition plan for
2to3 is:

 * Get your code working under python2.6 -3 without Python 3.0
deprecation warnings
 * Use 2to3 to migrate the code from 2.6 to 3.0

We can always use more contributors! (See separate thread.)

I don't recall vetting (or even seeing) that plan! Without the "-3"
option, 2.6 should accept the same syntax (or a superset) as 2.5. With
the "-3" flag, however, you may get warnings about stuff that changes
in 3.0. I don't like that "-3" would change the accepted syntax; for
that, we should use "from __future__ import ...".

A hypothetical example for octal numbers: I propose that bare 2.6
accepts either 0777 and 0o777 as octal literals. If you use "python
-3", you might get a warning about using 0777, although this is
borderline useless since 2to3 will take care of it just fine. If
people think it's worth it (I doubt it for this example) we could add
"from __future__ import octal_literals" which would prohibit 0777
altogether.

The 2to3 tool works from either baseline, but there is lots of stuff
it can't deal with (basically because 2to3 doesn't do type inference,
and it's unlikely that it ever will). In 2.6, the "-3" warnings will
help you find stuff that you should transform yourself. (Usually there
is a transformation that will do the right thing in 2.6 and which
will, after conversion by 2to3, continue to do the right thing in
3.0.)

> I'm also expecting that some chuck of users will be left in the 2.x world and that they would like highest version to be as clean as possible (with migration features going into the category of things that don't provide them any benefit).

They could either stick with 2.5 (or at least insist on compatibility
with 2.5) or use 2.6 without the "-3" flag. They might benefit from
the migration features 5 years from now, and until then they shouldn't
hurt.

As far as I am aware, we/GHOP have patches for all of the tests in 2.6
=> unittest or doctest.  They have not all been applied yet, but that
will come soon.

Speaking as someone with a few years experience in Python and quite a
bit of C knowledge, it is not at all easy to come up with a way to dive
into the core code.  For GHOP, it was a bit of a struggle to come up
with tasks; I ended up with three main sources of tasks:

 - a blog post asking people about their favorite poorly documented
   module;

 - the 3.0 spreadsheet and some grepping, to figure out which tests
   still needed to be ported over to unittest/doctest;

 - a test coverage analysis to figure out which modules were largely
   untested;

A parent of a GHOP student asked us if we could somehow come up with
a suggested task list for new contributors (not just GHOP students).
While this could be a lot of work, I think the contributions from GHOP
to core in the areas of test coverage, test porting, and module
documentation indicate that this kind of outreach may be very effective.
If you have ideas on how to keep such a task list fresh and up-to-date
as well as populated with good, simple tasks, I'm interested in hearing
from you!

Again, IMO as someone on the lunatic fringe of core development (i.e.
I'm a happy spectator, but I'm too busy to actually get much done):

Mentoring coders may not be a traditional route for hard-core OSS
developers, but it sure can be effective, as I've found with GHOP.

For example, many core Python developers can save an outsider hours of
effort by simply and quickly outlining the issues involved in a
particular patch or coding effort.  Having actual committers involved is
especially good, because they can evaluate whether or not a patch is
likely to be accepted, potentially cutting out more hours of effort; and

See http://bugs.python.org/issue1731. Should we consider it safe to
backport r57216 to 2.5.2? This is Thomas Wouters's code to disable
spurious tracebacks when daemon threads die. We're running some 2.4
apps with (a variant of) this at Google that get many 1000s of
invocations a day, so I'm pretty confident that it works.

If it fixes a bunch of unnecessary tracebacks which only add confusion whether
or not something is working I'm +1 on it.
Being on the grunt-side of handling bug reports anything that gets rid of
unnecessary bug reports is a good change to backport in my opinion.

I like that direction a lot better than the syntax proposals. This isn't 
the kind of thing that needs to get composed into bigger expressions, 
which is where clever uses of operators really shine. Here, I think the 
operators were subtracting clarity and your named function was adding 
clarity.

When I saw the OP, I actually wondered why people whose codebases are 
"filled" with the same try/except block over and over hadn't just 
written their own import_with_alternative function in the first place. 
If I wanted half my lines of code to be devoted to control flow and 
block structure, I'd write in one of those curly-brace languages :)

Whoops! I've committed r59707 to fix math.{floor,ceil}. Let me know if
you find any other problems. ... Hmm. I've also changed the behavior
of round(2.5). I'll change that back tomorrow morning.

I haven't seen any answers to the original question. It looks like
Decimal is decided by 2.5 too: return a float from everything.
Rational, being a completely new type, is up to you guys, but because
new support for the conversion routines seems to be rare, it's
probably best to have it return floats too.

I hope that when it comes time to change the issue tracker schema we
can have a reasonable difficulty rating.  That should also help for
Python bug days since we can say "look at easy bugs if you don't
really know C stuff, look at medium if you know C, and tackle hard if
you want to dive into the nitty-gritty".

Could work.  Don't know if another list is really needed; couldn't
python-dev handle general questions?  But then again, that is what the
tracker is for.

The keyphrase was "people whose codebases are 'filled' with ..." If they 
are maintaining a codebase, then I am sure adding one utility function 
to their library would be trivial. Or if you have enough of them in one 
file.. dedicating 7 lines of code for:

def import_any(*names):
     for name in names:
         try:
             return __import__(name)
         except StandardError:
             pass
     raise ImportError('no importable names')

, seems like a bargain for readability. Or to include the "None" case 
that people have brought up, we can spare 2 more lines:

def import_any(*names, **kwargs):
     required = kwargs.get('required', True)
     for name in names:
         try:
             return __import__(name)
         except StandardError:
             pass
     if required:
         raise ImportError('no importable names')

If nothing else, writing this email will remind me to avoid this 
try/except pattern in future codebases, if I have more than 1 instance 
of it (right about the break even point).

I dont think I would use this based on a survey of 16 cases over 35k lines
here.....

The proposed syntax could be easily used 11 times. 10 of those are the 'or
None' variant and account for platform-specific modules. 2 of those
currently issue a warning about the missing module in the exception branch,
but I guess I could live without that. 

Two other cases uses a different fallback value other than None; one a
string literal, and the other 'object'.

The remaining three cases do not really fit the proposed syntax. They are
currently in the form:
    try:
        import xxx
    except ImportError:
        recovery actions
    else:
        do something with xxx

For a core_mentor/padawan (wink) relationship to work ok, you need
that both parties get interested on working on the same stuff.

For example, Mark has been working a lot on Decimal, and I have been a
merely supervisor and committer of his changes, and we could generate
successfully a good patch flow.

I don't think that this can be successful when both parties tries to
handle wide portions of Python, but I'd love to see a lot of this
small sparks of productivity.

Now thinking of how to produce this relationships, I think that I will
change my approach to the issues. I'll start to be more aggressive
when reviewing a patch or bug. Aggressive in the sense of
asking/commenting/proposing even if I don't get the full grasp of the
issue. This could lead to a better interaction on the mid/long term,
even if in the short it appears to increase the noise a little.

Sorry, I didn't understand this parragraph.

Do you mean that the response in the following case is of type "float"?:

>>> round(decimal.Decimal("2.5"))
3.0

Subject: [Python-Dev] long(float('nan')) conversion
Message-ID: <fllb22$4ah$1@ger.gmane.org>

Hello!

Bug http://bugs.python.org/issue1481296 describes a problem where
long(float('nan')) causes a seg fault on Mac OS X. On other platforms it
returns 0L, e.g.

Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Oct  5 2007, 13:36:32)
[GCC 4.1.3 20070929 (prerelease) (Ubuntu 4.1.2-16ubuntu2)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> float('nan')
nan
>>> long(float('nan'))
0L

My patch to Python 2.6 adds an explicit check for NaNs to always return
0L. It did feel a bit strange but it's the default on some platforms.
Today an user pointed out that he doesn't like the patch, too.

How should the problem be solved? In my humble opinion
long(float('nan')) should return 0L in Python 2.5.2 for b/w
compatibility and raise a ValueError or OverflowError in Python 2.6+.

A while ago Georg suggested holding a bug day some time soon.  I
suggest Saturday January 19th.  It's a weekend day; it gives us two
weeks to prepare by drawing up bug lists; there's a PyPy sprint
January 12-19 (http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/news.html), so
it may be helpful to have the PyPy participants and the python-dev
participants available via IM/IRC all at one time.

January 12th or 13th would be an alternative date: less time to
prepare, but still overlapping with PyPy (they'll be starting instead
of winding down).

Does anyone feel strongly about the dates, or have other reasons to
choose one date or the other?  If not, I'll go with the 19th and
update the wiki page and send some announcements.

     result = []
     for match in template.pattern.finditer (template.template):
         if match.group ('invalid') is not None:
             # Raises ValueError
             template._invalid (match)
         if match.group ('escaped') is not None:
             continue
         # The "or None" should be moot.  It is there to ensure equivalent

Note that almost all the work is actually done by calling in to parts of 
the template object, so I think this should work properly with subclasses 
and other less common cases.

I would like to add this as a method of string.Template, which I think 
amounts to changing "template" to "self" and putting it in the Template 
class in string.py rather than on its own.  If the general idea is 
approved I would be happy to make a patch.

Also, on a related issue, does it make sense to scan the template string 
for invalid escape sequences in Template.__init__?  For the applications I 
can imagine of string.Template, I would prefer to get an error upon 
creating the Template object rather than arbitrarily later when I try to 
.substitute with it.

Hi all,

I've added a patch implementing a wrapper for siginterrupt on linux/unix
like platforms and attached it to
http://bugs.python.org/issue1089358 (which mentions a need for
siginterrupt).

Any chance to get this in?

	(issue846388)
Message-ID: <932f8baf0801040715saa29902udfcdb4d70ad81f2d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Currently the re module does not handle signals. I've been once a victim of
such a case in a real world setup (i.e. the python interpreter seems to hang
at 100% CPU  and is not interuptible with control c)

http://bugs.python.org/issue846388 opened 4 years ago contained a patch for
this issue (which ofcourse didn't apply).
I've updated that patch and added an example regular expression, which
'hangs' the python interpreter.
I think this issue should be handled.

Regards,
- Ralf

I've updated the bug day pages in the wiki:

	http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonBugDay
	http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonBugDayStatus

How do we want to flag good candidate bugs?  Should we add a keyword
to Roundup, or just list them on the PythonBugDayStatus wiki page?

Another task is to get logging set up for the #python-dev IRC channel.
Searching didn't find any existing archive; we could run it on
python.org somewhere, but does anyone here already run an IRC logging
bot?  Maybe someone could just add #python-dev to their existing
setup.

This one should be also updated:

All the issues pointed by it are already closed (or don't exist (!)).

The URL...

  http://moin.pocoo.org/Python25a

..., from the Question section, appears to be dead.

As this bug days are spurious, I think that just list them in the wiki
page is ok.

Make a patch regardless of whether you get any approval -- someone may
later have a different opinion, and writing a patch records your work.

No, create an is_valid() method at best.

It'd be nice if we can also get a bot into #python-dev to broadcast svn
commits and bug tracker changes. The Twisted guys have good bot with
decent msg coloring but IIRC it's tight into TRAC. For svn we could
probably use CIA bot and tie it into a svn post commit hook.

That seems a little peculiar to me: wouldn't it be more natural to have
round(Decimal_instance) return another Decimal?

Yes.

Now I find that now round() delegates its work to __round__:

  http://docs.python.org/dev/library/functions.html#round

This doc says that round() "Return the floating point value x rounded
to n digits after the decimal point.".

It don't specify if its binary or decimal floating point, ;)

Feel free to create an issue and assign to me if you think that this
should be done.

The trac integration is entirely optional, so don't let that discourage
you.

If anyone wants to investigate setting this up,

  svn://divmod.org/svn/Divmod/sandbox/exarkun/commit-bot

The code has no unit tests and there is no documentation.  Also notice
"sandbox" in the SVN URL.

The only real advantage that it has over CIA that I can point out is that
you don't have to write an XML or have a SQL server running in order to use
it.

In 3.0, round() of a Decimal should return an int if invoked with 1
arg, a Decimal if invoked with 2. Similar for round() of a float.
round() of an int can always return an int.

In 2.6, round() should always return a float, regardless of the type
of the first arg or the arg count, for best compatibility with 2.5.

Looks like in Python 2.6, round(0.5) right now returns 0.0, whereas in
2.5, it returns 1.0.

I think it should return 1.0, for best compatibility with Python 2.5.

Right.

I think the pre-3.0 rule should be: round(), math.floor(), math.ceil()
*always* return a float.

Should I round that to 0 whole winks or 1 whole wink?

Rounding 0.5 to 0 is a new fad, called round-to-even, or
statistician's rounding. Read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding .
It's a standard, and more correct when doing statistical calculations.
That's why we've chosen it for Python 3.0. But it should not bleed
into Python 2.6.

If long(nan) or int(nan) returns 0 on most platforms in 2.5, we should
fix them to always return 0 in 2.5 *and* 2.6. In 3.0 they should raise
ValueError.

It looks like long(inf) and int(inf) already raise OverflowError and
that should stay.

We should make sure inf and nan are treated correctly by the new
round(), floor() and ceil() in 3.0 -- it looks like right now
round(nan) returns 0, but it should raise ValueError. (Also, Jeffrey,
I thought math.floor() was to return an int? Or do I misremember?)

Thanks for the pointer.  Given that it's been an ASTM standard since 1940
and apparently in fairly common use since the early 1900s, I wonder why it's
not been more widely used in the past in programming languages.

That's correct. It's currently broken, but I was waiting to push on
http://bugs.python.org/issue1656 until the backport was figured out.

I'm thinking more about something to log all messages, so that participants 
can say "go see Raymond's explanation around 9AM".

For whoever's set up the CIA bot on python-dev: it seems to broadcast
messages twice.

Because programming language designers rarely are statisticians?

I've written a CIA notification extension for Roundup:
http://pastebin.ca/841568

It works standalone but I haven't been able to enable email and CIA
notifications in my local demo of Roundup. The output could probably use
some adjustments, too.

Can somebody please test it and integrate it into the bug tracker?

Subject: [Python-Dev] Need closure on __cmp__ removal
Message-ID: <ca471dc20801041118p63f8c9e5oe25a280be93aea0f@mail.gmail.com>

In the past some folks have been pushing for the resurrection of (some
form of) __cmp__, which is currently removed from Py3k (except for
some remnants which we'll clean up in due time).

I'd like to get closure on this issue. If someone volunteers within a
week to write a PEP, I'll give them a month to write the PEP, and then
I'll review it. The PEP better come with a patch implementing
(roughly) the desired behavior as well, relative to the 3.0 branch.

If I don't hear from a committed volunteer within a week, I'll drop
this and start removing __cmp__ references aggressively (starting with
issue #1717). Saying "if no-one else volunteers, I can give it a shot"
is not sufficient commitment. Saying "I will give it a shot" is. If
someone commits but no PEP+patch is in my possession by February 4
(and no attenuating circumstances have been brought to my attention),
I will assume the PEP won't happen and will start removing __cmp__
references. Once a PEP and patch are presented, I'll review them and
make a decision.

Because "add a half and chop" was also in wide use for even longer, is
also (Wikipedia notwithstanding) part of many standards (for example,
the US IRS requires it if you do your taxes under the "round to whole
dollars" option), and-- probably the real driver --is a little cheaper
to implement for "normal sized" floats.  Curiously, round-to-nearest
can be unboundedly more expensive to implement in some obscure
contexts when floats can have very large exponents (as they can in
Python's "decimal" module -- this is why the proposed decimal standard
allows operations like "remainder-near" to fail if applied to inputs
that are "too far apart":

    http://www2.hursley.ibm.com/decimal/daops.html#footnote.8

The "secret reason" is that it can be unboundedly more expensive to
determine the last bit of the quotient (to see whether it's even or
odd) than to determine an exact remainder).

I can't speak for the others, but I know I've decided not to pursue it.

Wow. Do you have an opinion as to whether we should adopt
round-to-even at all (as a default)?

Message-ID: <20080104195023.GA29828@amk-desktop.matrixgroup.net>

This post describes work aimed at getting Django to run on Jython:
http://zyasoft.com/pythoneering/2008/01/django-on-jython-minding-gap.html

One outstanding issue is whether to use Java's ConcurrentHashMap type
to underly Jython's dict type.  See
<http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html>.

ConcurrentHashMap scales better in the face of threading because it
doesn't lock the whole table when updating it, but iterating over the
map can return elements in a different order each time.  This would
mean that list(dict_var) doesn't return values in the same order as a
later call to list(dict_var), even if dict_var hasn't been modified.

Why?  Under the hood, there are 32 different locks, each guarding a
subset of the hash buckets, so if there are multiple threads iterating
over the dictionary, they may not go through the buckets in order.
<http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp08223/> discusses
the implementation, at least in 2003.

So, do Python implementations need to guarantee that list(dict_var) ==
a later result from list(dict_var)?

As I just posted to the blog, yes. Look at section 3.8 of the reference 
manual
(Mapping Types), specifically footnote 3:

http://docs.python.org/lib/typesmapping.html

(3) Keys and values are listed in an arbitrary order which is non-random,
varies across Python implementations, and depends on the dictionary's
history of insertions and deletions. If items(), keys(), values(),
iteritems(), iterkeys(), and itervalues() are called with no intervening
modifications to the dictionary, the lists will directly correspond.
This allows the creation of (value, key) pairs using zip(): "pairs =
zip(a.values(), a.keys())". The same relationship holds for the
iterkeys() and itervalues() methods: "pairs = zip(a.itervalues(),
a.iterkeys())" provides the same value for pairs. Another way to create
the same list is "pairs = [(v, k) for (k, v) in a.iteritems()]".

Ah, thanks!  I guess that rules out using ConcurrentHashMap, short of
materializing the entire list and sorting it in some way.  Oh well.

All,

I was showing a co-worker some python today (using the trunk) when I
stumbled upon this.  I was not sure what to think since I have never really
experimented with using spaces like this.  So here tis.  Be careful to
notice the spaces as they are significant here.

>>> 1.3.__str__()
'1.3'

>>> 1.3    .__str__()
'1.3'

>>> a = " somestring       "

>>> a          .split()
['somestring']

>>> a.         split()
['somestring']


Cool I suppose, except here's an odd man out:

>>> 1.__str__()
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    1.__str__()
            ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

>>> 1 .__str__()
'1'

It's parsed a floating point number - "1." - followed by the keyword
"__str__". That's not valid.

This one is a number "1" followed by the operator "." followed by "__str__".

The lexer reads the longest valid token each time.

FWIW, I would avoid the odd spacing and write this as:

For the sake of other implementations (Jython, etc) and for ease of reproducing the results with other tools (Excel, etc), the simplest choice is int(x+0.5).  That works everywhere, it is easy to explain, it runs fast, and it is not hard to get right.

my two cents,

What code would break if we loosened this restriction? I guess
defining d.items() as zip(d.keys(), d.values()) would no longer fly,
but does anyone actually depend on this? Just like we changed how we
think about auto-closing files once Jython came along, I think this is
at least worth considering.

I think this is exactly right. If you don't understand a certain aspect,
don't hesitate to ask. Maybe the submitter doesn't understand either,
and it was a flaw in the patch, or maybe there is a real issue, and
the submitter forgot to comment it properly - it's always the
submitter's fault if you don't understand :-)

I don't know what code would break today; this was initially added to  
the set of promises made by the dict methods a decode ago, but it was  
in response to a need in the software I was working on at the time  
(possibly Grail, for which 2.6/3.0 isn't an issue).

That question should probably be addressed to a fairly wide audience  
(comp.lang.python) since the promise has been there for so long.

I'm curious as to why.  Is it to avoid changing the behaviour of existing 
code (i.e., backwards compatibility), or do you see a design problem with 
having the Template constructor reject invalid template strings?

http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&q=+lang:python+zip+keys&start=10&sa=N
turns up a few pieces of code that would break:

trac-0.10.3/trac/versioncontrol/cache.py 
Twisted-2.2.0/twisted/pb/test/test_banana.py 
Mattricks-0.7/Mattricks/MatchPrediction.py 
FlickrUploadr-1.0.0/src/xmltramp.py 

Projects trying to stay compatible with Python versions that don't
have .items() may be more likely to use this idiom.  Some classes may
do this to implement .items(); openbabel-2.1.1/scripts/python/pybel.py
does this.  So some code will break, and I don't see a way to warn
about this problem before breaking compatibility.

> What code would break if we loosened this restriction? 

I can imagine someone has code like this:
  
   for k in d:
       print '%5s' % k
   for k in d:
       print '-----'
   for v in d.values():
       print '%5s' % v

It seems likely to me that a lot of code using d.values() would care about the order of the values and the only order that matters is corresponding to some set of keys.  There are probably a lot of functions that take keys and values separately, so it would not be uncommon to call those with a pattern like: save_config(configfile, d.keys(), d.values()).

In the OP's context where multiple threads are running, it may be fair to say that all bets are off.

I agree for the default.  Except the part where Excel, Jython, and 
Python's current round, actually use sign(x) * int(abs(x)+0.5), so maybe 
it's not *completely* easy to get right ;-).

Having other rounding methods *available*, though, would be neat.  The 
only application I've ever worked on where I cared about the difference, 
the user had to select it (since accounting requirements differ by 
jurisdiction and, apparently, by bank preference).  Having a standard 
way to express this (especially if it worked across different numeric 
types, but perhaps I digress) would be pleasant.  Implementing 
stochastic rounding and banker's rounding oneself, while not exactly 
hard, is a drag.

As a side note, you may also want to consider using a
NonBlockingHashMap as implemented by Cliff Click instead of
ConcurrentHashMap:

 http://blogs.azulsystems.com/cliff/2007/03/a_nonblocking_h.html
 http://blogs.azulsystems.com/cliff/2007/03/talking_with_go.html
 http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2139967204534450862
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/high-scale-lib

I haven't looked to see if it has the same issues repeatability issues
but it does scale even better.

Anyways, could you not use something with repeatability issues with a
wrapper that caches lists of keys to satisfy the repeatability?
(don't lock and maintain the list, just regenerate the list on demand
when a caller needs it and discard the cached list anytime a key is
added or deleted)

Also, should we drop this guarantee in py3k to give future
implementations more flexibility?

I think that there are still tons of people like me for whom 3.0 is  
still a future concern that is too big to devote cycles to at the  
moment, but are still very much interested in improving the 2.x  
series (which improves 3.0) at the same time.

I've been inspired by this thread to start working on a few 2.6 items  
that I had in mind, starting with http://bugs.python.org/ 
issue1663329 , which mostly just needed documentation and cleanup  
(now done).

Question: should patches include edits to whatsnew.rst, or is the  
committer responsible for adding a note?

I don't know how much, but I do know I've relied on this behavior before.
(In fact, I've asked about it before.)  I guess the counter question to
yours would be, "What would be gained by loosening this restriction"?  If
the answer is, "not much", then I don't see why this is even an idle

The decimal module already supports rounding modes in its context. For
other types, perhaps converting to decimal might be good enough?

I think the consensus is against round-to-even in 3.0 -- this requires
a PEP update as well as code changes. (Sorry for having caused so much
extra work, I should have flagged this earlier.)

It sounds like loosening the restriction would allow Jython to use an
implementation that is more efficient when used concurrently.

That may not be sufficient reason; Jython apps that need a more
efficient concurrent dict could import the ConcurrentHashMap class
directly, and CPython apps are out of luck anyway.

I'm not convinced that speed is a real issue in this case, since this
is only the explicit round() operation and not rounding for arithmetic
operations. But consistency with other languages is important.

Does the following patch to the PEP represent the consensus? If so,
I'll check it in, and update the py3k branch and wikipedia article to
match. I've allowed each type to define its own half-rounding behavior
so that Decimal can follow the current context, and float can, once
there's a portable way to set it (like C99's fesetround), follow the
current rounding mode (if people want that at the time).

Well, don't know.

It talks about the rounding in Python, but mentioning only the binary
floating point. In Decimal you have a lot of different roundings
available... it's worth to mention them?

I looked over the Java code briefly
(http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.java:HashIterator)
and I don't see anything that would cause it to violate this
condition. In particular, the locks don't affect the order.  It's a
complicated class though, so I could have missed it. Do you see a
reason for it to change its iteration order spontaneously? If another
thread is concurrently modifying the dict, that's an intervening
modification, and changing the iteration order is fine.

There's the second question of whether using ConcurrentHashMap for
python dicts is a good idea. I can't find any mention of thread-safety
in the Jython docs, so I assume it follows Java's rules, which are
that most variables must be locked in order to be accessed and
modified concurrently. Making dict a ConcurrentHashMap would provide a
stronger guarantee for some built-in types but not others, which is
likely to confuse people. Further, not all synchronized maps can be
replaced by ConcurrentHashMap because you may need groups of
operations to be atomic, while CHM only provides atomicity across
single method calls. I think a new ConcurrentDict class would probably
be a better way to integrate ConcurrentHashMap.

   IMO it's worth to mention the existing of them, briefly.

This is a VERY VERY rough draft of a PEP. The idea is that there should be
some formal way that reST parsers can differentiate (in docstrings) between
variable/function names and identical English words, within comments.

PEP: XXX
Title: Catching unmarked identifiers in docstrings
Version: 0.0.0.0.1
Last-Modified: 23-Aug-2007
Author: Jameson Quinn <firstname dot lastname at gmail>
Status: Draft
Type: Informational
Content-Type: text/x-rst
Created: 23-Aug-2007
Post-History: 30-Aug-2002


Abstract
========

This PEP makes explicit some additional ways to parse docstrings and
comments
for python identifiers. These are intended to be implementable on their own
or
as extensions to reST, and to make as many existing docstrings
as possible usable by tools that change the visible
representation of identifiers, such as translating (non-english) code
editors
or visual programming environments. Docstrings in widely-used modules are
encouraged to use \`explicit backquotes\` to mark identifiers which are not
caught by these cases.

THIS IS AN EARLY DRAFT OF THIS PEP FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY. ALL LOGIC
IS
INTENTIONALLY DEFINED ONLY BY EXAMPLES AND THERE IS NO REFERENCE
IMPLEMENTATION
UNTIL A THERE ARE AT LEAST GLIMMERINGS OF CONSENSUS ON THE RULE SET.


Rationale
=========

Python, like most computer languages, is based on English. This can
represent a hurdle to those who do not speak English. Work is underway
on Bityi_, a code viewer/editor which translates code to another language
on load and save. Among the many design issues in Bityi is that of
identifiers in docstrings. A view which translates the identifiers in
code, but leaves the untranslated identifier in the docstrings, makes
the docstrings worse than useless, even if the programmer has a
rudimentary grasp of English. Yet if all identifiers in docstrings are
translated, there is the problem of overtranslation in either direction.
It is necessary to distinguish between the variable named "variable",
which should be translated, and the comment that something is "highly
variable", which should not.

.. _Bityi: http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Bityi

Note that this is just one use-case; syntax coloring and docstring
hyperlinks are another one. This PEP is not the place for a discussion of
all the pros
and cons of a translating viewer.

PEP 287 standardizes reST as an optional way to markup docstrings.
This includes the possibility of using \`backquotes\` to flag Python
identifiers. However, as this PEP is purely optional, there are many
cases of identifiers in docstrings which are not flagged as such.
Moreover, many of these unflagged cases could be caught programatically.
This would reduce the task of making a module internationally-viewable,
or hyperlinkable, considerably.

This syntax is kept relatively open to allow for reuse with
other programming languages.


Common cases of identifiers in docstrings
=========================================

The most common case is that of lists of argument or
method names. We call these "identifier lists"::

  def register(func, *targs, **kargs):
      """register a function to be executed someday

      func - function to be called
      targs - optional arguments to pass
      kargs - optional keyword arguments to pass
      """

      #func, targs, and kargs would be recognized as identifiers in the
above.

  class MyClass(object):
      """Just a silly demonstration, with some methods:

      thisword     : is a class method and you can call
          it - it may even return a value.

          As with reST, the associated text can have
          several paragraphs.

          BUT - you can't nest this construct, so BUT isn't counted.
      anothermethod: is another method.
      eventhis -- is counted as a method.

      anynumber --- of dashes are allowed in this syntax

      But consider: two words are NOT counted as an identifier.

      things(that,look,like,functions): are functions (see below)

        Also, the docstring may have explanatory text, below or by
      itself: so we have to deal with that.
        Thus, any paragraph which is NOT preceded by an empty line
      or another identifier list - like "itself" above - does not count
      as an identifier.
      """
      #thisword, anothermethod, eventhis, anynumber, and things would be
      #recognized  as identifiers in the above.

Another case is things which look like functions, lists, indexes, or
dicts::

    """
    afunction(is,a,word,with,parentheses)
    [a,list,is,a,bunch,of,words,in,brackets]
    anindex[is, like, a, cross, between, the, above]
    {adict:is,just:words,in:curly, brackets: likethis}
    """
    #all of the above would be recogniszed as identifiers.

The "syntax" of what goes inside these is very loose.
identifier_list ::= [<initial_word>]<opening_symbol> <content_word>
{<separator_symbol> <content_word>} <closing symbol>
, with no whitespace after initial_word, and where separator_symbol is the
set of symbols ".,<>{}[]+-*^%=|/()[]{}" MINUS closing_symbol. content_word
could maybe be a quoted string, too.
In the "function name", no whitespace
is allowed, but the symbols ".,*^=><-" are. Thus::

    """
    this.long=>function.*name(counts, and: so |do| these {so-called]
arguments)
    {but,you - cant|use[nested]brackets{so,these,are.identifiers
}but,these,arent}
    {heres.an.example.of."a string, no identifiers in here",but.out.here.yes
}
    { even.one.pair.of.words.with.no
symbols.means.nothing.here.is.an.identifier}
    Any of these structures that open on one line {but.close.on.
    the.next} are NOT counted as identifiers.
    """
    #in the above: lines 1,2,and the parts of 3 outside the quotes
    #would be recognized as identifiers

The above flexibility is intended to cover the various possibilities for
argument lists in a fair subset of other languages. Languages which use only

whitespace for argument separation are not covered by these rules.

The final case is words that are in some_kind of mixedCase. These are only
optionally counted as identifiers if they are also present as an identifier
OUTSIDE
the comments somewhere in the same file.

Doctest and preformatted reST sections should be considered as 100% python
code and treated as identifiers (or keywords).

Recommended use
===============

The rules above are designed to catch the large majority of identifiers
already present in docstrings, while applying only extremely rarely to words

that should properly be considered as natural language. However, they are
inevitably imperfect. All docstrings of modules intended for wide use should
manually fix all cases in which these rules fail. If the rules underapply,
you can use either \`back quotes\` or parentheses() to mark words as
identifiers; if they overapply and reformatting tricks don't fix the
problem, <SOME DIRECTIVE TO TURN OFF ALL THIS LOGIC FOR A STRING>

Optional use inside comments or non-docstring strings
=====================================================

Comments
--------

Comments or blocks of comments alone on consecutive lines should be able,
optionally, to use these same tricks to spotlight identifiers.

Other strings
-------------

I'm not sure yet what the rules should be here. One option I'm considering
is to be able to turn on all the above logic with some evil hack such
as '' 'a string like this, concatenated with an empty string'.

A patch should contain edits for Misc/NEWS. Patches without
documentation and NEWS updates costs the committer more time and reduces
the likelihood of a commit.

Even a perfect patch costs several minutes of our life time. The patch
must be reviewed, applied, compiled, the entire unit test suite must
pass and finally it must be committed and the issues needs to be closed,
too.

Yes, that's the right thing to do.  I had missed it.  After all it is 
decimal rounding I want, and any financial applications I'm going to 
write these days are using decimals already for all the usual reasons.

At first I didn't realize why I'd missed this feature.  While the 
rounding *modes* are well documented, though, after 20 minutes of 
reading documentation I still haven't found a method or function that 
simply rounds a decimal to a given significant digit.  Is there one, 
should there be one, or is the user simply meant to use Context.quantize 
with appropriate arguments?

Several minutes?! The average "perfect" patch costs me more like
between half an hour and an hour.

quantize is about as close as it gets.  Note that it's a Decimal method as
well as a Context method, so you can invoke it directly on a given decimal:

>>> Decimal("2.34567").quantize(Decimal("0.01"))
Decimal("2.35")

I've also occasionally felt a need for a simple rounding function that isn't
affected by context.  Would others be interested in such a function being
added to Decimal?  I guess there are two possibly useful operations:  (1)
round to a particular decimal place ( e.g. nearest ten, nearest hundredth,
..) and (2) to round to a particular number of significant digits;  in both
cases, the user should be able to specify the desired rounding mode.  And
for each operation, it might also be useful to specify whether the result
should be padded with zeros to the desired length or not.  (i.e. when
rounding 3.399 to 3 significant places, should it produce 3.4 or 3.40?)

Any thoughts?

Yes:  yes :-)  There's no need to be unduly influenced by "some
obscure contexts when floats can have very large exponents", and the
decimal standard already weasels its way out of the bad consequences
then.  I should clarify that the standard "allows" relevant operations
to fail then in the same sense the IRS "allows" you to pay your taxes:
 it's not just allowed, failure is required.

Nearest/even is without doubt the rounding method experts want most
often, which is half of what makes it the best default.  The other
half is that, while newbies don't understand why experts would want
it, the underlying reasons nevertheless act to spare newbies from
subtle numeric problems.

As to what the numerically innocent /expect/, "(at least) all of the
above" is my only guess.  For example (and here I'm making up a very
simple one to show the essence), under the Windows native Python

    "%.0f" % 2.5

produces "3", while under glibc-based implementations (including
Cygwin's Python) it produces "2".  Over the years I've seen "bug
reports" filed against both outcomes.  According to the 754 standard,
the glibc-based result (nearest/even rounding) is correct, and the
Microsoft result is wrong.  Why fight it?  All the HW float operations
do nearest/even rounding now too (by default), ditto the decimal
module, and I'm secretly grateful the people who decided on those were
downright eager to oppose Excel's numerically innocent implementors
;-)

This "reads better" in many cases if you define a constant first, like:

PENNIES = Decimal("0.01")

... [lots of code] ...

rounded = some_decimal.quantize(PENNIES)

+1 from me.  Like the 754 standard, the decimal std is trying to
mandate a more-or-less minimal set of core functionality, with no
concern for user interface.  "Convenience functions" can be valuable
additions in such cases, & I agree it's far from obvious to most how
to accomplish rounding using the decimal facilities.

I think it's obvious ;-) that rounding 3.399 to 3 sig. dig. should produce 3.40.

Rephrasing Uncle Timmy: Decimal has so far focused on adhering to the
decimal standard, not on providing convenience to users.  As long as the
core continues to adhere to the standard, there's no reason not to add
convenience.

Just to be clear, this problem doesn't come up in round(), right?

Because in round(), you just test the evenness of the last digit
computed.  There is never a need to compute extra digits just to
perform the test.

I think pep 3141's round(x, ndigits) does (1). The only thing it
doesn't support yet is specifying the rounding mode. Perhaps the pep
should say that round() passes any extra named arguments on to the
__round__() method so that users can specify a rounding mode for types
that support it?

The Real interface doesn't say anything about significant digits, so
Decimal can do whatever we want. My first guess would be that round
should remove significant digits but not add them. (i.e.
round("3.199", 2) == "3.20" but round("3", 1) == "3".)

As you know, I'm working on a patch to implement 3141 for Decimal at
http://bugs.python.org/issue1623, which I'll update as soon as this
thread comes to a conclusion. Other people who are interested in
getting this right should add themselves to its nosy list so they can
object before I check something dumb in. :) I currently plan to keep
__round__ in 2.6's Decimal with 3.0's behavior because it no longer
affects the round() builtin in 2.6. Users who want it can call it
directly ? or we might provide, in 2.6, a module that provides 3.0
versions of the core library functions that change behavior so that
they can get the new round() explicitly.

That would clutter the interface.  Just specify a universal rounding mode for __round__ and have Decimal's implementation of that 
method comply.

If someone wants more control than that, they can manipulate the decimal object directly.

Right!  It's unique to 2-argument mod-like functions.

Right, round has to compute the last (retained) digit in any case.

For mod(x, y) (for various definitions of mod), the result is x - n*y
(for various ways of defining an integer n), and there exist efficient
ways to determine the final result without learning anything about the
value of n in the process.  For example, consider Python's pow(10,
100000000, 136).  It goes very fast to compute the answer 120, but
internally Python never develops any idea about the value of n such
that 10**100000000 - 136*n = 120.  Is n even or odd?  "remainder-near"
can care, but there's no efficient way I know of to find out (dividing
a 100-million digit integer by 136 to find out isn't efficient ;-)).

Given the fact Python 3k will use unicode natively for strings and, IIRC,
UTF-8 as standard encoding for Python files, have you thought about the
half-width and full-width characters like the ones you describe above? ??
are, for example, very common in Japanese where English would use quotes.

Yeah, thinking about this more, a .round() method on Context objects
seems like a better way to handle the part of Mark's request that the
round builtin doesn't cover. Of course, there may be even better
alternatives that I haven't thought of. I'll post a patch to
http://bugs.python.org/issue1623 tomorrow so we have something
concrete to talk about.

Thanks for the suggestion, Tim. Here's a new proposed patch to the

Decimal can follow the current context. I'll submit it tomorrow unless
there are significant objections.

Subject: [Python-Dev] pkgutil,
	pkg_resource and Python 3.0 name space packages
Message-ID: <4780F4E6.6040208@cheimes.de>

Hello!

We are discussing name space packages on the stdlib reorg list. For
Python 3.0 we plan to organize the packages by purpose, e.g. put all
database related packages like sqlite and shelve in a 'databases' name
space.

Of course we want to have the name spaces extensible by 3rd party
software. The Python world as currently two ways to create extensible
name space packages: pkgutil and pkg_resource.

pkgutil is part of Python 2.5. pkg_resource is scheduled for Python 2.6
and 3.0 in PEP 365 [1]. The PEP hasn't been accepted yet.

Questions:

* PJE: Is pkg_resource ready for Python 2.6 and 3.0?

* GvR: Are you going to accept Phillip's PEP?

* PJE: Does pkg_resource have an easy way to overwrite a package in a
name space package? E.g. an user wants to overwrite Python's
databases.sqlite with a newer version of sqlite. Can he simply do it by
inserting a package into sys.path before Lib/ ?

Message-ID: <18305.2168.79863.686868@montanaro.dyndns.org>


A ticket I opened on Roundup about a website issue some time ago was closed
today.  It was related to a different topic, but in the discussion I wrote:

    Is there some reason at this point that we need to maintain two separate
    trackers?  A ton of work went into making our Roundup instance what the
    key players wanted.  Why not use it to track website issues as well?
    With them separate you have two communities of maintainers and triage
    folks who are mostly disjoint.

    I assume there would be some trac-to-roundup conversion necessary.
    Perhaps something like that already exists.

Do people think it would be worthwhile to merge the Trac tracker content
(the issue tracker that holds tickets related to the python.org website)
into the Roundup tracker (the issue tracker that holds tickets related to
Python the language)?  While they are nominally distinct activities, it
seems to me that we must waste some precious resources (mostly people)
maintaining two mostly disjoint trackers.  There is also some functionality
overlap, mostly in the documentation area.

Do we really want to encourage this?  Wouldn't that just introduce
more pyxml-like nightmares?  I've been bitten way too many times by
pyxml overwriting the regular xml package and causing version
incompatibilities.  I'd hate for this kind of thing to become common
practice.

I think it would be a great idea.  As I try to get back up on a new,
"privacy=paranoid" machine, I went to mention that somewhere in the
logging in process, there should be an indication of how much your box
must be opened up before you can "log on," at least in the screen you
get to when you log on.
   However, each time I went to enter such a note, I needed to "log on."
I just gave up.

I like to give 3rd party software a chance to *extend* a name space
package like xml rather then to overwrite it. As far as I understand
your problem pyxml is overwriting the name space and claiming it for
itself rather than extending it.

The most recent problem was that pyxml installs a different version of
pyexpat so that ``xml.parsers.pyexpat`` != ``pyexpat``. This causes
problems with mod_python:

    http://www.dscpl.com.au/wiki/ModPython/Articles/ExpatCausingApacheCrash

What concerned me was your comment:

    E.g. an user wants to overwrite Python's
    databases.sqlite with a newer version of sqlite

Maybe the situation is different here, but having someone installing a
different version of sqlite behind my back makes me nervous.

Indeed.  It should also be noted that namespace packages are actually 
a very mature technology at this point.  Before setuptools, pkgutil 
already supported them, from the time of 2.3's release.

The extra feature proposed in PEP 365 isn't done yet.  Without the 
PEP acceptance, I didn't feel the need to rush on finishing 
it.  Apart from that, the pkg_resources module has been pretty darn stable.

OverRIDE, yes; overWRITE, no.

As long as the 'databases' package hasn't been imported or had its 
namespace declared yet, yes.

(I'm making the assumption, of course, that all of the namespace 
package requirements have been met: i.e., each package has a 
database/__init__.py that contains a namespace declaration and nothing else.)

Yes, that concerned me. Whether possible or not, I see this as bad
practice in general. On the other hand, allowing cx_Oracle to register
itself as databases.cx_Oracle - which is the basic "namespace"
functionality - is something I feel is important. (I have no idea if
the cx_Oracle author would want to do this, but I think the option
should be available).

Er, someone who?  Behind whose back?  I'm quite confused by what it 
is that's making you nervous.

Do you worry about people bundling newer versions of say, the 
optparse module or wsgiref with their applications?  If so, why?  Or 
if not, what's different?

I worry about exactly the pyxml problem. Someone installs pyxml on my
system, pyxml replaces xml.parsers.expat with a different version of
pyexpat than the rest of Python, and then programs like mod_python
crash because the two components were compiled against different
versions of a common library. Here's the link again that I posted
earlier:

    http://www.dscpl.com.au/wiki/ModPython/Articles/ExpatCausingApacheCrash

Note that this all happens "behind my back" because I didn't know that
pyxml would be replacing pyexpat in such a way that would cause this
crash.  In fact, I didn't even know that pyxml was installing pyexpat.

Yes, we should consolidate.  But first we need more manpower to manage
the tracker as it is now.  Some time this month I will be sending out
an announcement asking for more volunteers to help maintain the
tracker.  If we can get enough people to come forward to also help out
we can include moving the web site tracker over as well.

This is my worry as well (and why I was going to phrase the situation
in a more "should this be considered" tone than the way Christian
stated it.  =) .

But then again none of this is impossible even if we do leave out
extending the namespace.  Tweaking a package's __path__ value after
the fact is not exactly hard.  So even if we don't do this we are not
preventing anyone from extending the namespace, just discouraging.

My question becomes whether we want to allow something like this even
if we explicitly state people should not use this mechanism to
override pre-existing modules.  Do we want people tossing stuff into
the 'databases' package, or should the packages in the stdlib be
considered sacred? I am leaning towards not, but that's because I
personally like knowing that if I import something from a stdlib
namespace it is from the stdlib.  I don't want some bug report from a
naive user of cx_Oracle ending up in the stdlib because the import
came from the 'databases' package. And I would guess that if you don't
consider this a stdlib thing but for any third-party package that
other third-party packages would not love other packages mucking with
their namespace.

I see the point, but I'm against reserving generic package names like
"databases" for the stdlib, unless 3rd parties can add modules in
there. Another example might be "gui.tkinter" - why shouldn't "gui.wx"
be allowed?

If we want a "guaranteed-stdlib" package form, we should probably have
a top-level package, "std" or whatever. That notion has, I believe,
been shot down before (no time to look up references now).

   Mr Van Rossum has spoken against it many times.

   Now I think - if we don't want a separate Python's top-level namespace
may be we should think about a separate top-level non-Python's (3rd
parties') namespace? With it we could have database.sqlite (Python's
sqlite) and user.database.sqlite (a newer version); and by doing import
database.sqlite you know exactly what version you are importing.

Ah -- so this is 100% orthogonal to namespace packages, since this is 
something that can happen even without __path__ munging.

Namespace packages don't actually make this any easier, either, so I 
don't see how this reflects on the proposal.  Without a namespace 
package, packages earlier on sys.path *completely* override those 
that are installed later.  With a namespace package, only the 
specific submodules/subpackages that exist can override the ones that 
appear later.

IOW, without namespace packages, if you have two 'foo' packages, one 
containing 'bar' and the other both 'bar' and 'baz', then with 
namespace packages you'll always see a foo.bar and a foo.baz, with 
the contents of foo.bar depending on path order.  *Without* namespace 
packages, the exact same thing is true of foo.bar, but foo.baz will 
also be either visible or invisible depending on the path order.

In other words, the status quo actually has *more* variability of what happens.

So, while it might be a good idea to advise people against replacing 
packages they don't "own" or at least making it prominently visible 
that a package replaces something in the stdlib, it doesn't (so far 
as I can tell) have anything to do with the merits of namespace 
packages one way or the ohter.

Unless there is something else I'm missing?

Bleh.

I'm +1 on allowing third-party additions to the same 'database'
namespace that the stdlib puts packages in. People will just have to
get used to the package, and not the namespace, determining who to
complain to.

In theory, it might make sense to allow libraries to "close" some
namespaces to deal with Brett's worry, but I think the consenting
adults rule says not to bother.

This is actually an excellent point, given that the actual intended 
use of namespace packages is to allow an *organization* to control a 
namespace: e.g. zope.* and zc.* packages, osaf.* packages, 
etc.  Using names that have meaning (like "email" or "databases") 
sort of goes against the whole point of namespace packages in the first place.

For some reason, I wasn't thinking about that when the original post 
came through.

So, now that I've thought about it, I'm -1 on the stdlib using 
*top-level* namespace packages to sort out its contents (e.g. 
"databases" as a top-level package name)

If we want to allow separately-distributed *upgrades* or bugfix 
releases of projects (such as an updated sqlite module), then using 
2nd-level namespace packages like "std.databases.*" would allow that.

Note, by the way, that this implies that somebody creating their own 
Oracle driver would *not* be expected to put it into 
std.databases.  Again, the whole point of a namespace package is to 
reserve that namespace for packages produced by a particular 
organization, similar to the way e.g. the 'org.apache.projectname' 
packages in Java work.

There seems to be a misunderstanding. This is *not* going to happen
for standard library package names. I'm fine with inventing mechanisms
to allow 3rd party packages to beo cobbled together from multiple
contributions (it would seem to make sense for e.g. Twisted or Zope).
But I am absolutely squarely against 3rd party installs adding to (or
worse, overriding) standard library package names. This is (to me)
simple common sense, the reason being "knowing who to blame". We get
enough bug reports in the Python tracker about 3rd party software as
it is.

(In general I'm not keen on attempts to create a single unified
ontology for library modules. It's like expecting all doctors in town
to live on the same street. But my feelings on keeping a clean
demarcation between standard and 3rd party are much stronger.)

I don't have a strong opinion as PJE but tend to agree with his point of
view. We must not reserve a complete set of top level names and close
them for 3rd party software.

*Either* we create subject area packages (e.g. databases, web) and open
them for 3rd party software *or* we create a top level name space for
Python's stdlib and reserve it for our own purpose.

For the initial example of "databases.sqlite" I think py.db.sqlite has a

I like to see a possibility to easily upgrade, bugfix or extend a stdlib
package with 3rd party extensions. PEP 297
(http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0297/) contains some useful ideas.

I don't have a strong opinion as PJE but tend to agree with his point of
view. We must not reserve a complete set of top level names and close
them for 3rd party software.

*Either* we create subject area packages (e.g. databases, web) and open
them for 3rd party software *or* we create a top level name space for
Python's stdlib and reserve it for our own purpose.

For the initial example of "databases.sqlite" I think py.db.sqlite has a
nice ring to it.

Why not? 3rd party software can copy the same hierarchy under its own
toplevel package, e.g. zope.db, zope.net, etc.

Regarding using common words, either the stdlib grabs these, or
*nobody* gets to use them (for fear of conflicting with some other 3rd
party package grabbing the same).

Java's example notwithstanding, I don't want "py" or "python" to be
part of the stdlib package namespace. *If* (part of) the stdlib has to
live under a single distinguished name, pick something like "std" or
"core". When I'm using Python I already know I'm using Python, I don't
want to be reminded of that fact on every import line.

I see mostly possibilities for abuse here. Linux vendors can install
bugfixes or using their own packaging system.

FWIW, I don't think all of these patches are helpful.  The implementations are so easy and the effects are so obvious, that it is 
simply better to decide what to do first, then do it afterwards.

My own preference is to leave the decimal module alone (except for a __round__ method to be called by builtin.round).  Adding more 
methods to that module does not make it easier to use -- there are already a mind-numbing range of choices in the current, minimal 
implementation of the spec.  I would support having a separate module of convenience functions or a separate module that uses a 
subset, but growth of the core module will only make it harder to use and more difficult to maintain.  Another idea for 
simplifcation is to write-up a good tutorial to the basics of using the module.

Please show restraint when proposing API changes to decimal -- I think it would be easy to do more harm than good.

You must mean __trunc__ to support builtin.trunc(), since
builtin.round no longer calls __round__ in 2.6. The other 3 methods
specified by PEP 3141 aren't strictly necessary for 2.6, but they will
be needed for 3.0. I'd rather not make the two versions of Decimal
gratuitously different, so this patch puts them in the 2.6 version
too. That's basically all of the changes in this patch, so I'm not
sure exactly what you're objecting to. Could you be more precise?

I think some things make sense to move some things into a common  
namespace:
hashlib, email, xml et al...

I also think there are probably other candidates for similar grouping  
and cleanup, but I don't have a well thought out set. (db, url??,  
zip??); and I think it is happening, albeit slowly.

At first blush I am +1 for a third party or non stdlib namespace;  
user is already a module though.
Other ideas: sitepkg, addon, extra, ext

But then what of packages that are already namespaced? It would be  
tedious to;
from sitepkg.zope.app.interface import SomeThing

So while I like the idea, I think I am against wedging everything  
into namespaces just for the sake of it; at the end of the day I  
think I am -1 on *requiring* it.

Additionally, I have only been reading this list for a week or so and  
feel a little like I may be injecting a novice and poorly formed  
opinion into a discussion that has been ongoing for years. Please  
pardon my ignorance if this is the case.

This isn't quite true; a standalone Python application that isn't 
extensible doesn't need to worry about this.  And it's standalone 
apps that are most likely to claim these common words.  (For example, 
until recently, Chandler's database library packages were in 'repository.*'.)

But of course this is still a pretty minor point overall.  If the 
stdlib does go for deeper nestings, I have a slight preference for 
seeing them under std.* or some such rather than top level.  But I 
don't really see a whole lot of point to doing a major re-org of the 
stdlib space to begin with, for the simple reason that package names 
are not really categories -- they're *names*.  IMO 'from databases 
import sqlite' doesn't add any value over 'import pysqlite3' to begin with.

Worse, it will likely be an attractive nuisance for people saying 
"why don't we have databases.Oracle?" and suchlike.  And you still 
have to remember the names, only now they're longer.  And was it 
database or databases?  Greater uniqueness of names is just another 
reason flat is better than nested.  :)

If I understand you correctly, then the patch backports magic methods that do not have corresponding invocation methods in Py2.6. 
So, they are basically useless. If that's true, then the patch is clutter -- it makes 2.6 less desirable.  It is not obvious to me 
how this will help someone transition to Py3.0.  I'm curious to hear how Guido makes the call on this.

Also, the goal of keeping versions identical across 2.6 and 3.0 is at odds with previous discussions where I believe we said that 
that is *not* the goal and will likely not even be possible in many cases.  Besides, if the invocation of the magic methods is 
different in 3.0, how are you going to keep the test suite code the same across versions?

There should probably be a PEP sets clearer guidelines about what should be backported from Py3.0.  Perhaps something like this:
* If there is a new feature that can be implemented in both and will make both more attractive, then it should be in both.
* If something is going away or changing in 3.0, then the 2.6 conversion tool mode should warn about it if possible.
* If neither of the above apply, then leave 2.6 alone.

> I'm not
> sure exactly what you're objecting to. Could you be more precise?

You note said: "I'll implement Context.round() in a separate patch. Comment away."

Unless I misread what you're trying to do, that is a gratuitous API build-out (whether talking about Py2.6 or Py3.0) which adds a 
second-way-to-do-it to a module that already has a huge number of methods.  Our goal is to keep that module as a minimal 
implementation of the spec.  Fattening the API will make the module harder to use, not simpler.

Right. Packages are useful if it helps make the sub-names shorter. The
email package is a good example: it uses lots of generic names like
errors, charset, encoders, message, parser, utils, iterators.

I tend to agree. 2.6 and 3.0 decimal already differ plenty.

Can you volunteer a draft? It could be PEP 3003. I'm probably too
close to 3.0 to be able to objectively write this, which really
represents end users' desire for stability in 2.6.

Given Guido's agreement, expect another version of this patch with
only __trunc__.

Oh, sorry for not being clear then. I don't intend to write or discuss
that separate patch until this one's approved and submitted. I think
it's worth discussing eventually, but this change is more important. I
mentioned this sentiment at http://bugs.python.org/msg59417 too, but
clearly wasn't explicit enough in either case.

It's hard to keep up with all of these patches and I'm growing concerned
that some will sneak by.  In the case of complex proposals, it is often
helpful to have a patch that we can discuss concretely, but in the case of
simple ones like this, they just clutter to patch tracker.  There's no need
to create the patch until the idea has been discussed.

In the case of Context.round(), I've already advised against it.
So, I'm not sure why you still intend write a separate patch
and bring it back up for discussion.  Ideally, it should die right now.

The sentiment is unchanged -- please do not build-out the API for the
decimal module.  It is intended to be minimal and needs to stay that
way.  Further additions will only make it harder to use, harder to
maintain, and will complicate efforts to rewrite the module in C.

Why is __trunc__ being backported?  Is a trunc() builtin being backported?  What is the point for a synonym for int() and __int__ in 
Py2.6.

Unless I'm missing something, this doesn't improve Py2.6 in the least.

You're certainly right to be concerned. The most significant patch,
the original backport of 3141, _did_ sneak through. The only email
I've gotten about it has been in response to my question about a
detail. I don't know how I could have made it more obvious though:
nobody who suggested the backport (http://bugs.python.org/issue1623)
seemed to think it would be contentious enough to suggest emailing
this list first. Since then, I've tried to keep things transparent by
suggesting that you add yourself to the nosy list of
http://bugs.python.org/issue1623, which is where I'll post any patches
before thinking about committing them.

I always like to have a patch around because abstract discussions,
even (especially?) on simple topics, have a tendency to run off into
the weeds. A patch keeps things focused and moving forward.

You advised against it. Tim, Mark, and glyph advised for something
like it. I think it's consistent with the fact that most operations on
Decimal instances are mirrored on Context instances, and __round__
will be an operation on Decimal instances. That doesn't sound like
enough agreement to simply drop the discussion.

I am not building out the decimal API. I am adding enough methods to
maintain the comment that "Decimal floating point objects share many
properties with the other builtin numeric types such as float and int.
All of the usual math operations and special methods apply." in both
2.6 and 3.0. After that's done, I am interested in talking about
adding one method that 3 people on this list have been interested in.
I understand that you need to be vigilant against extraneous methods,
but I'm really not just adding these on a whim.

The trunc() builtin was backported in
http://svn.python.org/view?rev=59671&view=rev and hasn't been rolled
back. All of the reasons to include trunc() in 3.0 apply to 2.6. A
couple that I like are: if trunc had been around in the beginning,
__index__ would have been unnecessary; and the name says what it's
doing, unlike int(). I don't know what Guido's reasoning was for
accepting it into the PEP.

Please recognize that our little system of patches and newsgroup
discussions is easily overwhelmed by someone who is so prolific.
Your work will not receive quality review and discussion if the
volume blows beyond the bandwidth of the other participants.

Arghh!  You seem hell-bent on jamming this in.  Please leave the
decimal module alone.  It does *not* need both a round() method
and a quantize() method.

I read Glyph's note and agree that it wasn't obvious how to round
with the existing API.  That is a documentation problem, not a call
to add duplicate methods.

When one of the module authors asks you to refrain for expanding
the API, please pay special attention.  In this case, you are working
directly against a core philosophy for the design and maintenance
of the module.

OK, that seems pretty clear.

In which case, I'm -1 on having a "databases" package in the stdlib
(this discussion should probably move back to the stdlib reorg list
now). Keeping things like sqlite at the top level seems fine to me.

I don't have a general rule I'm applying here - I think each
suggestion should be considered on its own merits.

   When I'm using Jython - am I using Python of Java? After

from java.lang import Class

   should it be

from py import exceptions

   or

from core import exceptions

   ?

Regardless of whether this would really be helpful or not (I used
to be in favor of this some time ago, but then realized that this
doesn't really buy you anything much), please be aware that by
using new generic top-level names you are likely going to get
into conflict with existing applications.

'databases' will likely work since most apps will use 'database'
as module or package name.

This is not a good idea. The standard lib should not be extensible
by 3rd party packages, instead they should use their own top-level
package and deal with whatever namespace extension mechanism is
used in that package.

I don't think pkg_resources should go into Python 2.6 as is -
for the reasons I've stated last year when this question
came up.

I also don't like the import mechanism hackery that's being
used in setuptools to get namespace packages working.

IMHO, it would be a lot cleaner to extend the existing import
mechanism to support search continuation, ie. have the import find
mechanism continue the search for a sub-package if it doesn't
find the module in the first instance of a top-level package
directory.

E.g. say you want to import 'a.c' and you have directories
on you sys.path:

libs1/a/
libs1/a/__init__.py
libs1/a/b.py
libs2/a/
libs2/a/__init__.py
libs2/a/c.py

the import mechanism would look in libs1/a/, see that c.py is
not available, then continue the search and find libs2/a/c.py.

This is a sketch, but I think you get the idea.

Next, we add a per-user site-packages directory to the standard
sys.path, and then we could get rid of most of the setuptools
import and sys.path hackery, making it a lot cleaner.

Agreed, but one of the main arguments for all the .pth file hackery in
setuptools is that having to change PYTHONPATH in order to enable
user installations of packages is too hard for the typical user.

We could easily resolve that issue, if we add a per-user site-packages
dir to sys.path in site.py (this is already done for Macs).

PYTHONPATH already provides this functionality.  I see no need to  
duplicate that.

Question.

I'm so used to quantize that I don't care. And I'm, in general, -0 to
adding new methods to Decimal and/or Context.

But in Py3, when you make round(x), x.__round__ will be executed. Same
with trunc, ceil and floor. And I think that Decimal should grow these
__xxx__ methods.

Having said that, the only thing that is not clear to me is if we should:

- Diverge 2.6 and 3.0 decimal.py code

- Add these __xxx__ to 2.6, and have still one code of decimal.

Guido voted for this last one, in the issue 1623:

"""
If there aren't too many differences between the 2.6 and 3.0 version of
decimal.py and your patch, do 2.6 first, then the next time we merge
stuff into 3.0 from the trunk it'll be forward-ported automatically.
"""

But, in the light of this thread, and the new PEP that you will be
writing, I think that now it's time to decide this.

It would be great to merge into Roundup.  The Trac instance is ancient
and I've not had the time to try to upgrade it, which would indeed
now be a waste of effort.

When Roundup is ready, please let me know and I can at least make a pass
through the pydotorg tickets to close those that aren't worth moving
over to Roundup.  There are quite a few stale and questionable items.
In fact, it wouldn't be the end of the world to discard almost
all of them, but still worth a review.

I'm not sure what this buys given that you can do this using
PYTHONPATH anyway, but because of that I also can't be against it. +0

Excuse me.  I have always thought that "quantize()" makes Decimal
confusing in the context of the other mechanisms that Python makes
available for other kinds of numbers.  I have refrained from making an
issue of it because I understand and (mostly) support the idea of
keeping Decimal restricted to matching the decimal standard, but at this
point, it seems that Tim Peters likes the idea, too.  While I have a lot
of respect for you, I think Uncle Timmy deserves some special respect,
too.

I'm not a current maintainer, but I was one of the instigators for the
existence of Decimal.  I understand that you're feeling frustrated about
changes getting shoved in, but I don't think that discussion should be
shut down because you have a particular point of view: the decimal
module does not represent only your work.

I suggest that the patches get dropped for the moment and the discussion
rebooted.  I haven't been following closely, but it seems that the main
issue is that Python 3.0 is introducing a __round__() method.  How do you
think the decimal module should handle that?  (Although I still like the
idea of a .round() method for decimals, I think that round(Decimal()) is
probably sufficient enough that I won't insist on it.)

I think it's PEP-worthy too, just so that the semantics get nailed  
down.  Here's a strawman proto-quasi-pre-PEP.

Python automatically adds ~/.python/site-packages to sys.path; this is  
added /before/ the system site-packages file.  An open question is  
whether it needs to go at the front of the list.  It should definitely  
be searched before the system site-packages.

Python treats ~/.python/site-packages the same as the system site- 
packages, w.r.t. .pth files, etc.

Open question: should we add yet another environment variable to  
control this?  It's pretty typical for apps to expose such a thing so  
that the base directory (e.g. ~/.python) can be moved.

I think that's all that's needed.  It would make playing with  
easy_install/setuptools nicer to have this.

I'd suggest to make the "~/.python" part configurable by an
env var, e.g. PYTHONRESOURCES.

Perhaps we could use that directory for other Python-related
resources as well, e.g. an optional sys.path lookup cache (pickled
dictionary of known package/module file locations to reduces Python
startup time).

I believe you're mistaken: there is no import mechanism "hackery" in 
pkg_resources.  (__path__ is a documented *hook*, not a hack, and 
it's the only import-related hook that pkg_resources uses).

And, if you don't like namespace packages, perhaps you should be 
campaigning for this to be removed:

http://python.org/doc/2.4.1/lib/module-pkgutil.html

pkg_resources only updates the routine provided in pkgutil to be a 
bit more automatic, and to better support PEP 302 and zipfile importing.

Actually, neither PYTHONPATH nor your proposal solve all of the 
problems that .pth files do.  To date, nobody has proposed any real 
substitute for them.

What about including the Python version in the directory name?  C 
Extensions may not work correctly across versions, and bytecode will 
get recompiled a lot if you're using multiple versions.  Also, if 
this is a 2.6/3.0 change, it's likely that the *source* won't be 
compatible across versions either.  :)

Assuming that this is a true "site" directory (i.e., .pth files are 
recognized), then yes.

No doubt, the spec made a number of choices that are obvious only if you work at IBM. And, there is no doubt, the module has a high 
level of complexity.

Jeffrey is proposing to add a Context.round() method with the purpose of making the module easier to use. I contend that this is 
self-defeating on the face of it.  Please count the number of existing Context methods ( 
http://docs.python.org/dev/library/decimal.html#context-objects ) and tell me that adding yet another method will reduce complexity 
or shorten the learning curve.  In fact, it will just further confuse which method should be used.

Also, I thought we were committed to a minimal implementation of the spec. One reason for this was that programs could be ported 
back and forth with other implementations of the spec.  Another reason is that the core spec has extensive test cases while 
build-outs have none. And another reason is that we are trying to make life easier for someone (perhaps me) to rewrite the module in 
C.

There is also the principle of having only one way to do it.  However, we already have Decimal.quantize and Context.quantize and are 
about to introduce a number of magic methods callable from builtin functions. Do we really need even more ways to round?  The 
rounding operation is so fundamental to the module that user must grapple with it at some point.  Having multiple ways to do it will 
only make that task more difficult.

I spent about a month of my life cleaning, documenting, and testing the decimal module to get it ready for prime time. I'm not at 
all pleased at the current proposal to add a duplicate method.

If someone really cared about making the module easier to use, I would fully support efforts to write a tutorial on the fundamentals 
or an effort to write a client module implementing only a subset of the spec.

So only do the 'databases' package if we can change the modules names
to make it worth it?  So whichdb becomes databases.which, dumbdbm
becomes databases.dumb, etc.? And then extend this to any other
package that we consider creating? Otherwise leave it out?  How would
that follow for sqlite since that is not going to get any shorter
thanks to a package?  Should it still go into the package for
organizational purposes?

In other words, should the stdlib reorg only introduce new packages if
the majority of modules that go into the package end up with a shorter
name?

Bad example IMO; these are all about relatively simple "dict-on-disk"
APIs, not about (relational) databases. I'd be +0 things like dbm.gnu,
dbm.any, dbm.dumb, dbm.which.

If you're asking me, the "organizational purpose" is 100% misguided.

See what others say.

Another reason to have a top-level package would be if there are a lot
of subpackages/submodules. This applies to the xml package for
example.

OK. So an html package could have htmllib for its __init__ (or
html.lib), and then have html.entities and html.parser for
htmlentitydefs and HTMLParser, respectively.  Another example is http:
http.lib, http.server.cgi, http.server.base, http.server.simple.

Both examples are grouped because they make sense, but primarily to
make the tail module name simpler.

The only place I can see that coming into play is if there is any
desire to group OS-specific modules together.  Otherwise I think
Tk-specific stuff is the only place where this has not been done
before.

D'oh, yes of course.  So make that:

~/.python/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages

Actually, I'd be inclined not to have both HTMLParser and htmllib  
(regardless of names); a single capable interface should be provided.   
But that's a separate discussion.

It is my hope that there will be a great deal of restraint in the effort to group modules into packages in Py3.0.

For the most part, putting modules in packages only makes them more difficult to access and introduces an additional burden of remembering which package to invoke. 

The best existing indicator we have is the organization of the docs for the standard library. I, for one, have a hell of a difficult time finding modules via the "organized" table of contents in the Library Reference. Instead, I always go the the Global Module Index where the somewhat flat namespace makes it easy to go directly to the module of interest. I'm curious whether the other developers have had the same experience -- if so, then it is a bad omen for over-organizing the standard library.

Another indicator of what lies ahead is the current organization of os vs os.path.  While that split-out was well done and necessary, I routinely have difficulty remembering which one contains a function of interest.  

There are handful of groupings that are obvious (i.e. html and socket modules going into an internet package).  Outside of those, I think it best to leave the rest of the modules in a flat namespace (I don't want to have to quess where to find queue, random, pickle, pprint, decimal, and collections.

I think most of the concerns with the standard library revolve around module quality, duplication, and obsolence. In contrast, I do not think that introducing a hierarchy of namespaces is of interest to most users. That exercise may well make the language harder to use/learn, not easier.

my-two-cents-ly,

Raymond

Yes, I have the same problem. I had not considered this, but I agree
that it's the best indication available of how a hierarchical
organisation might end up, and what issues there might be.

One man's obvious is another man's confusing. I'd stick to Guido's
principle, that packages should only be used where they simplify
sub-names. And even there, use restraint.

I know I was earlier tending more towards the side of having more
packages. I've been convinced otherwise.

In that case how about:

~/.local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages

or:

~/local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages

I believe both of these locations are already in use by various systems
/ people, so it would fit in better with existing practice.

This would be ideal.

What would be used on Windows? It's likely to be of marginal use on
Windows, but an appropriate equivalent should be defined. Possibly
just replace ~ with %USERPROFILE%. I'd argue against anything under
%APPDATA% as that directory is hidden.

I nearly always use my browser's search function to find the module of
interest, so yes, I'm effectively using a flat namespace.

I mostly remember, but there are some notable exceptions: exists (posix
system call, expect to find it in os), walk (which is the old deprecated
one? have to check doc).

I'd be very reluctant to have more "asymmetric" packages like os where
the package contains functionality at the top level as well as
submodules, because it means that anyone using one of the submodules
will pay the price of importing the top-level package. In this
example, I can easily see someone using htmlentitydefs without needing
htmllib.

That sounds like a good one.

Well, that's a little different -- plat-* and lib-tk are not
subpackages but subdirectories. For the plat-* subdirs, this is done
so that the same logical module name can have different
implementations per platform. For lib-tk it was done to make it easier
to create a distribution that didn't include any Tk stuff. But the
test package structure doesn't follow this lead, and I'm not sure if
it still makes sense for lib-tk. OTOH maybe lib-tk could be promoted
to being a real package (named tkinter?), with the core tkinter
functionality in __init__ and the rest in submodules with names
conforming to PEP 8; this is one example where that type of
organization actually makes sense.

The installers should give the user the choice at install time 
(preferably). A '--user' flag would also be useful (IMHO).

+1 from me

PEP 3107 (function annotation), PEP 3104 (nonlocal) and PEP 3132
(extended iterable unpacking: a, *b = 1,2,3) are IMHO other useful
feature for 2.6. nonlocal would require a __future__ import.

No, we shouldn't mess with the profile root directory on Windows. The
data should either be installed under "Application Data" or under "My
Documents". You are right, the appdata directory is hidden by the
installer could add a link to Application Data\Python\python2.x\ to the

I also don't like the idea to replace ~ with another string. Every OS is
probably using a different path (~/.python/ on Linux, ~/Library/Python

two methods: global_sitedir() and local_sitedir([username]).

doesn't have an API to get the directories from the registry. Is

If the platform-specific stuff is made into their own packages (e.g.,
unix, mac, win, tkinter, etc.) then this can apply generically across
the stdlib (sans Modules, of course, unless we eventually change how
we handle building extension modules such that they are kept in /Lib
as well).  I think that would be nice in terms of organization of the
code and the documentation as it makes it more obvious which modules
are platform-specific.

Is applying this to OS-specific modules work for you like it does for
tkinter stuff?

That is definitely a concern of mine and the removal of obsolete code
is still the primary motivation for me for this reorg.  But I also
realize that if we can group reasonable modules together (as you and
Guido have now both suggested based more on similarity and coming up
with shorter names) then I think we should take the chance now.

I was never planning on organizing the entire stdlib into a complete,
one-level deep hierarchy.

Hello all,
I've recently been granted commit privileges; so, following the usual
protocol, here's a quick introduction.  I'm a mathematician by day;  my
degree is in number theory, but five summers of Fortran 77 programming and
two semesters of teaching numerical analysis have given me a taste for
numerics as well.  I discovered Python around twelve years ago and found
that it fit my brain nicely (even more so after nested namespaces were
introduced) and now use it almost daily for a wide variety of tasks.  I've
been lurking on python-dev for longer than I care to admit to.  I also
dabble in Haskell and O'Caml.

I'd like to say a huge thank you to Facundo Batista:  I've been helping him
update Decimal to the most recent specification over the last few months,
and without his support and encouragement I certainly wouldn't be writing
this now---he's been a fantastic guide and mentor.

Please don't hesitate to let me know if there's anything I can help out
with;  I'm primarily interested in mathematical, numerical, and algorithmic
aspects of Python at the moment, but am looking to broaden my knowledge of
the internals.  I've got so much out of Python over the years, and I hope I
can now give something back.

Mark

No answers yet, but a clue, and anyone on OSX should now be able to
reproduce this (with 2.5, 2.6 or 3.0) as follows:

  ./python ./Lib/test/test_sys.py | cat

That is, the problem happens when stdout is redirected to a pipe (or a file).

Not My Documents, please! That's for documents, not configuration.
%USERPROFILE% is actually where most other applications put stuff. The
alternative would be %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% which is what
os.path.expanduser uses.

It would probably be a good idea to have it in the core, although I'm
sure it's in pywin32, and anyone coding Python on Windows will have
that. Personally, I've no code that would benefit from this, so I'd be
+0 on theoretical grounds only.

Redirecting stdout also fails for both the trunk and the py3k branch for 
me on Ubuntu. If I redirected stderr as well then the tests worked again.

Given that a pipe/file and the console very likely *do* have different 
encodings, maybe the test is just wrong?

Cheers,
Nick.

This sounds like a problem I recently blogged about (verbatim copy):

When you use Python with sys.stdout you might run into a problem where
sys.stdout.encoding suddenly becomes None. This happens due to the fact that
upon using a pipe or redirection, at least under Unix, it falls back to not
knowing anything about the target. In order to work around this you can add a
fallback to use locale.getpreferredencoding(). So if you use encode() on a
string you can do something like:

from locale import getpreferredencoding
 
text = u"Something special"
 
print text.encode(sys.stdout.encoding or getpreferredencoding() or 'ascii', 'replace')

This is how we currently use it within Babel as well for printing the locale
list.

On mys system only one application has put configuration data directly
into USERPROFILE. It's Python's IDLE and I don't like it. It should
store its configuration under APPDATA.

I also don't agree that Python extensions are configuration data. They
are code, maybe plugins and the files are user editable content. Ms
products like Visual Studio store files like them in My Documents.

Python's _winreg module and pywin32 expose several functions to get the
paths from the registry but I don't think it has a simple function like
get_mydocuments().

Since we're talking about class decorators, I have a question about function
and instancemethod objects.  The following code works

class Root(object):
   def index(self):
       return "Hello World!"
   index.exposed = True

but this code

class Root(object):
   def index(self):
       return "Hello World!"
index.exposed = True

gives the following exception

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'instancemethod' object has no attribute 'exposed'

I can tell that instancemethods can't have attributes added to them outside
of their class definition.  Is this part of the Python language spec, or
just an implementation detail of CPython?

I bring this up here because it makes writing certain class decorators much
more annoying.  For example, if I want to write a class decorator that will
set "exposed=True" for every method of a class, I must resort to
shenanigans.

You can't modify the attributes of an instance method. You have to
modify the attribute of the function object.

No, you don't. You have to retrieve the function object from the
instance method object. The example should shed some light on the problem:

>>> class Root(object):
...    def index(self):
...        return "Hello World!"
...    print type(index)
...    index.exposed = True
...
<type 'function'>
>>> type(Root.index)
<type 'instancemethod'>
>>> Root.index.exposed
True
>>> Root.index.exposed = False
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'instancemethod' object has no attribute 'exposed'
>>> Root.index.im_func
<function index at 0x8354e64>

Christian,

Thanks for the example; I'm sorry that I didn't read the docs carefully
enough to realize that I could extract the original function and set the
attribute on that.

CSIDL_PROFILE (FOLDERID_Profile)
    Version 5.0. The user's profile folder. A typical path is
C:\Documents and Settings\username. Applications should not create files
or folders at this level; they should put their data under the locations
referred to by CSIDL_APPDATA or CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA.

Mostly the former, though I'm not sure about the performance

and very recently, I implemented similar functionality myself (though it 
isn't in use in Twisted yet):

    http://codebrowse.launchpad.net/~glyph/+junk/pyexport/files

Something that I notice about every other implementation of this 
functionality is that they're all in Python.  But the proposed 
implementation here is written in C, and therefore more prone to 
crashing bugs.  Looking at the roundup log, I can see that several 
refcounting bugs have already been found and fixed.  Perhaps the post- 
import hooks, being a modification to the import mechanism itself, needs 
to be in C, but given that lazy imports *have* been implemented before 
without using C code (and without post import hooks), I can't see why 
they need to be in the same PEP.

Also, as is my custom, I'd like to suggest that, rather than designing 
something new, one of the third-party implementations be adopted (or at 
least its interface) since these have been demonstrated to work in real 
application code already.  Happily, I can escape the charge of bias this 
time since I don't think my own implementation should be taken seriously 
in this case :).

Correct, the first few patches were rough implementation sketches. I
wanted to discuss implementation details with PJE and it was the easiest
way to exchange code. A distributed VCS would have made the task easier
but that's a different story. Eventually I focused on the reference
counter and I straightened out some ref count bugs.

Deferred loading of modules can be implemented without post import hooks
and vice versa. But PJE urged me to - at least - consider lazy modules /
deferred importing in the post import hook implementation. 3rd party
tools need a way to interact with the hooks and notify the system when
their own lazy module implementation loads a real module.

I figured out I could write a PEP for both features in one PEP and
implement them in a combined patch. I could separate them and create two
PEPs.

:)

I *did* mention that my implementation of lazy imports is based on PJE's
peak.util.import:

"""
PJE's peak.util.imports [3] supports lazy modules an post load hooks. My
implementation shares a lot with his and it's partly based on his ideas.
"""

Finally I like to say something about my choice to implement the lazy
loading in C. Most implementation like zope.deferredimport, Hg's
demandimport and bzr's lazy_import are using the proxy design pattern.
They are storing a wrapper object in the module and sys.modules instead
of the real module and they are loading the real module when an
attribute is accessed. Some of some (brz) are even using some strange
scope replacing. I've to study the implementation more carefully to
understand what's going on.

peak.util.imports' way is slightly different. It return the instance of
a module subclass. When the real module is loaded it redirect name
lookup of the lazy module to the real module by replacing the
__getattribute__ and __setattr__ methods of the lazy module with the
methods of the real module.

My implementation uses a similar approach. But I've the luxury that I
can modify the C implementation of the module class. It makes the
load-real-module-when-attribute-is-accessed dance much easier. I don't
have to write a proxy or deal with name spaces.

However the PEP covers only the basic infrastructure for lazy imports.
For example imp.lazy_import("a.b.c") doesn't put "a" and "a.b" in
sys.modules. It neither doesn't cover the replacement __import__ hook
provided by Hg nor the deprecation feature of zope.deferredimport. Such
infrastructure functions can be implemented in Python.

Please remember, the PEP is a draft. I'm waiting for comments and
suggestions from users and developers.

Message-ID: <fm1kth$v3u$1@ger.gmane.org>

Today I stumbled about an unknown and undocumented (?) feature. At least
it's not documented in our docs. __import__ can import a module by file
name:

>>> open("/tmp/example.py", "w").write("test = 23\n")
>>> mod = __import__("/tmp/example")
>>> mod
<module '/tmp/example' from '/tmp/example.py'>
>>> mod.__name__
'/tmp/example'
>>> mod.__file__
'/tmp/example.py'
>>> mod.test
23

Is it just a coincidence? Is it a desired feature? Why isn't it documented?

That's probably a mistake.  In the early days of peak.util.imports 
(which is now available as the "Importing" package on PyPI), I went 
through a lot of hairy edge conditions regarding such matters as when 
parent packages must be present, and ensuring the correct runtime 
ordering of post-import callbacks.

Although I glanced at some of your earlier patch versions and had 
comments, you should be aware that I have *not* validated it for 
these sorts of trickier timing considerations, mostly because I'm not 
100% sure what they are any more, only that I made sure 
peak.util.imports could handle them.

Sounds like a coincidence. Looks like it's using os.path.join(X, name
+ ".py") where X is a member of sys.path, e.g. the initial ".". This
gives good results for valid module names (which never contain
slashes) but in this example, os.path.join() ignores the first
component if the second starts with '/'.

Feel free to add a check that the module name doesn't contain '/',
'\\' or '.'. (I think that silently accepting other non-identifier
characters is fine, since it doesn't interfere with parsing either the
module name or the filename.)

Careful with the name though. Microsoft Windows Vista did away with 'My
Documents & Settings'. It is now C:\Users.

So you get:

C:\Users\<name>\AppData\Local\    (former Local Settings\Application Data)
C:\Users\<name>\AppData\Roaming\  (former Application Data)
C:\Users\<name>\Documents         (former My Documents)

Somewhat off topic, but hooray, it looks like someone at MS rediscovered 
the command line and why "Long and Wordy Names with lots of spaces" are 
really annoying. Easier access to the application data directory is a 
good thing too.

I guess moving to Vista wouldn't be all bad then ;)

To get marginally back on topic, I would actually prefer to have a 
function like os.gethomedir() that takes on optional user name. (I don't 
want it enough to write a patch to make it happen though)

Cheers,
Nick.

Note today's Coding Horror blog entry: "Don't Pollute User Space"

http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001032.html

 Keep your dirty, filthy paws out of my personal user space!

Take a look in your Documents folder right now. Go ahead. Look. Do you 
see any files or folders in there that you personally did not create? If 
so, you've been victimized. Applications should never create or modify 
anything in your documents folder without your permission.
{snip...]
If applications need to store shared files, that's what the \AppData and 
\Application Data folders are for.

Sentiments I agree with...

Michael

Yes, with the one proviso that Windows (XP, at least, maybe Vista is
actually better in this regard) makes it extremely difficult for the
user to manually do anything in these directories, so that I'd say
this is only appropriate for fully application-maintained files. As
far as I know, Windows lacks any really sensible place to store
application configuration data which is meant to be user edited on
occasion (e.g. rc/ini files, startup scripts, etc).

That's often what I see ending up in %USERPROFILE% - even though as
Christian points out, it's "officially" wrong.

Some brief thoughts from me on the PEP...

Post import hooks sound great and a good idea.

Lazy importing sounds like a recipe for hard to find bugs and rather
too magic for my taste.

Perhaps you should separate these two things into two PEPs and
implementations?

Only because Windows XP uses a stupidly long path with spaces in it. 
It's not actually *hard* to navigate manually to these directories.

If the windows installers created by the 'bdist' commands allow you to 
automatically put stuff there then it shouldn't be too much of a problem.

What user editing is *meant* to be done with extension modules installed 
into a site directory. Programmer editing maybe... :-)

The directories are also hidden. That does make it hard to navigate
there. I know you can un-hide hidden files, but I view the hidden
attribute as useful - just badly misused in this case, unless you
assume that these directories are intended to be left alone by the
user.

Sorry, I had drifted slightly off topic here. I don't have a problem
with user-specific extensions going in appdata, on the presumption
that we're talking code only (and excluding something obscure like
distutils' distutils.cfg file).

My latest version uses the SHGetFolderPathW() function from ShlObj.h.
It's the preferred way to get shell folder paths like CLSID_PERSONAL (my
documents). It's compatible with 2000 and newer (maybe even older, but
we don't support ME, NT4 or older) and works on Vista, too.

It's not an issue for experienced users. For the rest we can put a link
in the start menu under Python 2.5 which opens a new explorer with the

Um, I'm an experienced user and it's an issue for me...

The problem isn't so much knowing where the directory is, as that
tools (quite rightly) ignore (ie, hide!) hidden directories. For
example, 4NT (my command shell) doesn't auto-complete hidden directory
names by default, many tools' wildcard matching ignores them (always,
not just by default).

Blast, I said I wasn't going to start a big flamewar over Windows behaviour.

I haven't seen anyone propose that something intended to be edited by
a user be stored in a hidden directory (appdata) on Windows. As long
as that is the case, I don't care.

If you are suggesting that a file intended to be viewed/edited by a
user manually should go in AppData, then please be explicit. We can
then argue the concrete issues, rather than just theoretical
principles.

Paul.

And now that I think about it some more, so long as the post-import hook 
implementation recognises that lazy import libraries *exist*, all it 
really needs to do is provide a way for the externally implemented lazy 
import to trigger whatever import hooks have been registered when the 
module is finally loaded.

So count me in with the people that think it is worth separating the two 
ideas - just focus in the PEP on the API needed to make it possible for 
3rd party implementation of lazy imports to interoperate correctly with 
the post-import hooks, without proposing to add such an implementation 
directly to the standard library.

In the hands of power users lazy imports can definitely be a useful 
trick to speed up script start times. Those kinds of users will know 
where to find one of the existing solutions, or will write their own (as 
the responses to this thread seem to suggest). But I still have deep 
reservations about making them available as a standard library feature. 
My main concern is that the import lock is something Python users 
typically don't have to worry about (aside from the 'don't spawn a 
thread as a side effect of importing' guideline), but making the 
acquisition of the import lock implicit in accessing a module attribute 
is going to lead to some very nasty surprises for users that aren't as 
intimately familiar with the underlying mechanics of the import system.

Cheers,
Nick.

I know Neal has access (if I'm recalling the various checkin message 
correctly, he did the lion's share of the work in addressing the 
problems Coverity reported). I think some of the other folks on the 
security list may have one also.

Searching the SVN version history for references to Coverity may provide 
an interesting list.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Changing PyAPI_DATA(type) into PyAPI_DATA(type,
	variablename)?
Message-ID: <191CF299661D6E4EA39DC5DB2D4EB73E05388447@esebe105.NOE.Nokia.com>

Hello, python-dev!

One-liner summary: Would it be possible to change PyAPI_DATA(type) into
PyAPI_DATA(type, variablename) to help portability to funny platforms?

We've been working on porting the Python 2.5.1 core to the Symbian S60
smartphone platform. Unlike the previous 2.2.2 port, this time we're
trying really hard to keep our changes clean so that they could some day
be accepted into the main Python codebase. One problem we've encountered
is that Symbian doesn't properly support exporting data from a DLL, and
instead we must export a function that returns a pointer to the variable
in question, and hide this from client applications using a macro:

In a generated header, dataexports.h:

	#define Py_Verbose (*__DATAEXPORT_Py_Verbose())
 	extern __declspec(dllimport) int *__DATAEXPORT_Py_Verbose();

In a generated C file, dataexport.c:

	__declspec(dllexport) int *__DATAEXPORT_Py_Verbose() { return
&Py_Verbose; }

dataexports.h is included into Python.h when Py_BUILD_CORE isn't
defined.

Now, the problem is that we haven't figured out any way to define the
PyAPI_DATA macro in its one-argument form so that this scheme would
work, since when compiling client applications we'd like all the
PyAPI_DATA declarations to expand to nothing, and get the declarations
from dataexport.h instead. The best solution we've come up with is to
change PyAPI_DATA into a two-argument form and change all declarations
accordingly. Whether to export data with this mechanism or directly
could be a pyconfig.h option, DATA_EXPORT_AS_FUNCTIONS (or
HAVE_DATA_EXPORT?). Briefly the changes would touch:

pyport.h:
	#ifdef Py_BUILD_CORE
	#define PyAPI_DATA(RTYPE,NAME) extern RTYPE NAME // data item
not exported from the Python DLL
	#else 
	#define PyAPI_DATA(RTYPE,NAME) // PyAPI_DATA can be blank since
then the real declarations come from dataexports.h
	#endif

pydebug.h and all other files that declare exported data:
	PyAPI_DATA(int) Py_VerboseFlag;
	-->
	PyAPI_DATA(int, Py_VerboseFlag)

In addition, complex types such as function pointers and arrays would
need to be typedef'ed, e.g.:

	PyAPI_DATA(char) *(*PyOS_ReadlineFunctionPointer)(FILE *, FILE
*, char *);
	-->
	typedef char *(*t_PyOS_ReadlineFunctionPointer)(FILE *, FILE *,
char *);
	PyAPI_DATA(t_PyOS_ReadlineFunctionPointer,
PyOS_ReadlineFunctionPointer)

and multiple PyAPI_DATA declarations on a line would need to be split to
several PyAPI_DATA declarations.

If this change isn't acceptable then we'd pretty much have to fork this
aspect of the interpreter - either by just maintaining a patch that's
applied to the headers or by making a preprocessor that fixes the
headers on the fly.

Does this sound reasonable? Any better ideas?

I can't answer your question. I don't have access to the Python project

Quick response: this sounds fine to me. Of course, changing it in 2.5.x
is not possible, but making the change in 2.6 should be possible. I
would like to see some explicit rationale being recorded in the source
so that people know what this was meant for and won't change it back.

I'm pretty sure I have an account and I can't get in either. I have
contacted coverity asking if they can give accounts to other core

I'm frustrated as well. Neither AppData nor MyDocuments fulfill our
requirements. I don't argue for AppData, I only argue against
UserProfile as the base directory for a user package directory. I'm open
for any suggestion which doesn't violate MS' style guides.

(I don't want to imply that I like the style guide but we don't make the
rules :( )

On this page, when I click the 'sign in' link, I see the page 
  http://scan.coverity.com/maintenance.html
which says:

"""

Normally, project members will have received notification in advance of any lengthy unavailability of their project.

Could it be that they were a little bit early with the press release,
and the rung2 scanner is not yet active?

Seems they are referring to the results of the rung 1 run (what ever 'rung' means ;-).
With the account Neal made me some months ago, I can login on this page:

   http://scan.coverity.com:7475/

and see the scan results for Python.

Last run at 2007-12-27: 11 Outstanding Defects, 6 of them marked "uninspected",
3 marked "pending", and 2 marked "bug".

Somehow I suspect that the lazy import PEP will be postponed or reject.

My dict says: rung (of a ladder)-  Leitersprossen

Python has climbed up one step (or rung) of the ladder.

Probably.

After the split, I'll review things again, with a closer eye on the 
initialization order issues, especially with respect to ensuring that 
lazy imports set the corresponding attribute in the parent package at 
the right point in time.  (It should happen *before* the submodule 
can actually be imported.)

The big advantage to a stdlib implementation of lazy modules would be 
that it could be more vetted and "blessed" -- the downside is that 
it's a new and nontrivial implementation.  :(

For what? If you're talking about a per-user site-packages directory,
I have no problem with AppData (as Michael said, there's no intention
that users be able to edit the files). Of course,
modules/packages/extensions don't really qualify as application
*data*, so it is a somewhat odd usage certainly, but it's not
disastrous.

Windows doesn't really have a concept of a per-user application code directory.

Come to that, if I use a bdist_wininst installer to install a package
in my personal site packages, then I log off and you log on, would you
expect to see my package when you look in add/remove programs? Would
you expect to be able to uninstall it? Would you expect to be able to
install a personal copy of your own? What would we see in add/remove
programs *then*??

No matter how you cut it, Windows isn't designed for per-user
installable programs. Maybe a per-user site-packages just isn't
appropriate on Windows.

Paul.

PS This is mostly theoretical for me, as I don't have a personal need
for a per-user site packages directory on any of the machines I use.

This reminds me of the early days of Microsoft Terminal Service (read: 
"X Window done wrong fifteen years later"), when various applications 
had to be modified to stop saving per-user data in global locations. It 
underlines the fact that essentially Windows is still betrayed by its 
original conception as a single-user system.

The idea that users would /program their own computers/ was totally 
alien to the Windows mindset.

Hi,

I've taken a look at some bugs in the bugtracker. I think these should be
closed:

http://bugs.python.org/issue1720992 is about automatic imports.

http://bugs.python.org/issue1448325
and
http://bugs.python.org/issue1566086

is about the regular expression engine "hanging". These are duplicates of
http://bugs.python.org/issue1662581 and should be closed.

Subject: [Python-Dev] PEP: Post import hooks
Message-ID: <fm3vbs$msu$1@ger.gmane.org>

I've parted the former PEP as promised. Here is the post import hook.
I'll tackle the other half of the PEP later.


PEP: 369
Title: Post import hooks
Version: $Revision$
Last-Modified: $Date$
Author: Christian Heimes <christian(at)cheimes(dot)de>
Status: Draft
Type: Standards Track
Content-Type: text/x-rst
Created: 02-Jan-2008
Python-Version: 2.6, 3.0
Post-History:


Abstract
========

This PEP proposes enhancements for the import machinery to add
post import hooks. It is intended primarily to support the wider
use of abstract base classes that is expected in Python 3.0.

The PEP originally started as a combined PEP for lazy imports and
post import hooks. After some discussion on the python-dev mailing
list the PEP was parted in two separate PEPs. [1]_


Rationale
=========

Python has no API to hook into the import machinery and execute code
*after* a module is successfully loaded. The import hooks of PEP 302 are
about finding modules and loading modules but they were not designed to
as post import hooks.


Use cases
=========

A use case for a post import hook is mentioned in Nick Coghlan's initial
posting [2]_. about callbacks on module import. It was found during the
development of Python 3.0 and its ABCs. We wanted to register classes
like decimal.Decimal with an ABC but the module should not be imported
on every interpreter startup. Nick came up with this example::

   @imp.when_imported('decimal')
   def register(decimal):
       Inexact.register(decimal.Decimal)

The function ``register`` is registered as callback for the module named
'decimal'. When decimal is imported the function is called with the
module object as argument.

While this particular example isn't necessary in practice, (as
decimal.Decimal will inherit from the appropriate abstract Number base
class in 2.6 and 3.0), it still illustrates the principle.


Existing implementations
========================

PJE's peak.util.imports [3]_ implements post load hooks. My
implementation shares a lot with his and it's partly based on his ideas.


Post import hook implementation
===============================

Post import hooks are called after a module has been loaded. The hooks
are callable which take one argument, the module instance. They are
registered by the dotted name of the module, e.g. 'os' or 'os.path'.

The callable are stored in the dict ``sys.post_import_hooks`` which
is a mapping from names (as string) to a list of callables or None.


States
------

No hook was registered
''''''''''''''''''''''

sys.post_import_hooks contains no entry for the module

A hook is registered and the module is not loaded yet
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The import hook registry contains an entry
sys.post_import_hooks["name"] = [hook1]

A module is successfully loaded
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The import machinery checks if sys.post_import_hooks contains post import
hooks for the newly loaded module. If hooks are found then the hooks are
called in the order they were registered with the module instance as first
argument. The processing of the hooks is stopped when a method raises an
exception. At the end the entry for the module name is removed from
sys.post_import_hooks, even when an error has occured.

A module can't be loaded
''''''''''''''''''''''''

The import hooks are neither called nor removed from the registry. It
may be possible to load the module later.

A hook is registered but the module is already loaded
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The hook is fired immediately.


C API
-----

New PyImport_* API functions
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

PyObject* PyImport_GetPostImportHooks(void)
    Returns the dict sys.post_import_hooks or NULL

PyObject* PyImport_NotifyModuleLoaded(PyObject *module)
   Notify the post import system that a module was requested. Returns the
   module or NULL if an error has occured.

PyObject* PyImport_RegisterPostImportHook(PyObject *callable, PyObject
*mod_name)
   Register a new hook ``callable`` for the module ``mod_name``

The PyImport_PostImportNotify() method is called by
PyImport_ImportModuleLevel()::

   PyImport_ImportModuleLevel(...)
   {
        ...
        result = import_module_level(name, globals, locals, fromlist,
level);
        result = PyImport_PostImportNotify(result);
        ...
   }


Python API
----------

The import hook registry and two new API methods are exposed through the
``sys`` and ``imp`` module.

sys.post_import_hooks
    The dict contains the post import hooks:  {"name" : [hook1, hook2], ...}

imp.register_post_import_hook(hook: "callable", name: str)
   Register a new hook *hook* for the module *name*

imp.notify_module_loaded(module: "module instance") -> module
   Notify the system that a module has been loaded. The method is provided
   for compatibility with existing lazy / deferred import extensions.

The when_imported function decorator is also in the imp module,
which is equivalent to:

def when_imported(name):
    def register(hook):
        register_post_import_hook(hook, name)
    return register

imp.when_imported(name) -> decorator function
   for @when_imported(name) def hook(module): pass


Open issues
===========

The when_imported decorator hasn't been written.

The code contains several XXX comments. They are mostly about error
handling in edge cases.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

The new features and API don't conflict with old import system of Python
and don't cause any backward compatibility issues for most software.
However systems like PEAK and Zope which implement their own lazy import
magic need to follow some rules.

The post import hooks carefully designed to cooperate with existing
deferred and lazy import systems. It's the suggestion of the PEP author
to replace own on-load-hooks with the new hook API. The alternative
lazy or deferred imports will still work but the implementations must
call the ``imp.notify_module_loaded`` function.


Reference Implementation
========================

A reference implementation is already written and is available in the
*py3k-importhook* branch. [4]_ It still requires some cleanups,
documentation updates and additional unit tests.

The big problem here is that the interaction with laziness is 
actually pretty complex, when it comes to re-entrancy and 
initialization order.  A package can actually import a submodule, and 
not yet be finished importing, for example.  So you can actually have 
child hooks executing before parent hooks in this case.

The "Importing" package prevents this by not registering child hooks 
until a parent is actually imported, thus guaranteeing a sane hook 
execution order.  Relative order for hooks targeting the same module 
is maintained, but parent module hooks are guaranteed to execute 
before child hooks, even if the child finishes importing before the parent.

This would be a bit trickier to implement with your C API, since 
"Importing" does this by registering a lot of lambdas.

But, now that I've reviewed my own code and pieced back together the 
rationale for it doing things in this seemingly-odd way, it makes sense.

There's also one twist that I haven't sorted out yet: "Importing" 
guarantees that a parent module 'foo' will have a 'bar' attribute for 
the 'foo.bar' module, if 'foo.bar' is lazy.  It does this by 
registering a callback, ideally *before* any other callback is 
registered for 'foo' or 'foo.bar' that would look at 'foo.bar'.  I 
don't see how to maintain this condition in a world where import 
callbacks can be registered independently.

Bleah.  All of the above isn't really a good explanation of the 
problem.  Let me try to simplify it:

* Lazy importing needs to guarantee that foo.bar = 
sys.modules['foo.bar'], when callbacks for 'foo.bar' execute (in case 
they refer to foo.bar)

* To do this, it registers a callback that sets foo.bar = 
sys.modules['foo.bar'], and does not actually register any foo.bar 
callbacks until 'foo' is really imported (and thus foo.bar gets set 
by that callback)

In the case of the PEP, it's harder for me to figure out what 
happens, because you might not have any lazy modules around, and the 
foo.bar issue would then not come up.  You also have the possibility 
of a problem where a lazy import callback occurs in 3rd party code, 
while callbacks are occurring from the import machinery.  (Which 
means that the notification API should probably set the hooks entry 
to None while it's running, so that if it's called from inside a 
hook, it will not double-run the hooks, and new hooks registered 
while hooks are running will get run immediately as they are 
encountered, instead of getting added to the list.)

They botched the link where it says Sign in.  Use the link Thomas posted, ie:

That will show you the results from the latest coverity checker.

I think only Coverity can add people.  You can send them a message if
you would like to be added: scan-admin at coverity.com.  Or you can send
mail to me and I can forward along all the people that would like to
be added.

I'll wait a few days to collect names so I can batch up the request.

The 6 have been inspected by me and I never came to a conclusion of
whether they were a problem or not.  There are 3 things which should
be fixed and I haven't gotten around to them.  They are not a big
deal:

Python/traceback.c  	line 177
Objects/codeobject.c  	line 322
Modules/mmapmodule.c  	line 1080

For traceback.c, namebuf defined on line 155 should be moved out one
block since filename is an alias to namebuf and it is used outside the
current scope.  I think this is unlikely to be a problem in practice,
but is technically wrong and should be fixed.

For codeobject.c, line 327 should not be reachable.  I kinda like the
code as it is even though it is currently dead.  I never decided if I
wanted to change that or suppress the warning.

For mmapmodule.c, fd should be checked for -1 before calling stat on line 1064.

The rest were not obvious problems to me, and I never returned to them.

Sorry, I forgot to answer the second part of your question.  I have no
idea how they compute Defects/KLOC.  But the data is very old so I
wouldn't worry about what that says.

The most recent run has 286622 lines in 602 files.  I already
mentioned the 3 defects that should be fixed.  Not sure what to do
about the rest.

Doesn't the module remain in post_import_hooks, only mapped to None to 
indicate that any hooks should be run immediately? (Finding an object in 
sys.modules isn't enough, due to the possibility of it being a 3rd party 
lazy module rather than the actual module).

Nick.

Actually, the alien idea is that more than one person would use the

On looking at this, it doesn't seem like an actual problem.  fstat(-1,
...) returns a -1 and errno is set to EBADF, 'bad file descriptor'.

	/* on OpenVMS we must ensure that all bytes are written to the file */
        fsync(fd);
#  endif
	if (fstat(fd, &st) == 0 && S_ISREG(st.st_mode)) {
	     ...

In rev. 59888, I've added 'fd != -1' to the 'if' just to save a
pointless fstat() call, and made the OpenVMS fsync() call similarly
conditional, but I don't think this item is a bug, much less a
security bug.  I won't bother backporting this to 25-maint, unless
asked to do so by the 2.5 maintainer.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Backporting PEP 3101 to 2.6
Message-ID: <47861E4A.4020006@trueblade.com>

(I'm posting to python-dev, because this isn't strictly 3.0 related.
Hopefully most people read it in addition to python-3000).

I'm working on backporting the changes I made for PEP 3101 (Advanced
String Formatting) to the trunk, in order to meet the pre-PyCon release
date for 2.6a1.

I have a few questions about how I should handle str/unicode.  3.0 was
pretty easy, because everything was unicode.

1: How should the builtin format() work?  It takes 2 parameters, an
object o and a string s, and returns o.__format__(s).  If s is None, it
returns o.__format__(empty_string).  In 3.0, the empty string is of
course unicode.  For 2.6, should I use u'' or ''?


2: In 3.0, object.__format__() is essentially this:

    class object:
        def __format__(self, format_spec):
            return format(str(self), format_spec)

    In 2.6, I assume it should be the equivalent of:

    class object:
        def __format__(self, format_spec):
            if isinstance(format_spec, str):
                return format(str(self), format_spec)
            elif isinstance(format_spec, unicode):
                return format(unicode(self), format_spec)
            else:
                error

     Does that seem right?


3: Every overridden __format__() method is going to have to check for
string or unicode, just like object.__format() does, and return either a
string or unicode object, appropriately.  I don't see any way around
this, but I'd like to hear any thoughts.  I guess there aren't all that
many __format__ methods that will be implemented, so this might not be a
big burden.  I'll of course implement the built in ones.

Thanks in advance for any insights.

Eric.

Since this is a new feature, why bother with strings at all
(even in 2.6) ?

Use Unicode throughout and be done with it.

I was hoping someone would say that!  It would certainly make things 
much easier.

But for my own selfish reasons, I'd like to have str.format() work in 
2.6.  Other than the issues I raised here, I've already done the vast 
majority of the work for the code to support either string or unicode. 
For example, I put most of the implementation in Objects/stringlib, so I 
can include it either as string or unicode.

But I can live with unicode only if that's the consensus.

Eric.

Agreed, the early allocation of a few hundreds bytes on the stack won't

Please suppress the warning. I removed the last two lines and GCC
complained "control reaches end of non-void function". It's not clever
enough to understand that cmp can never be 0.

if (fd != -1 && fstat(fd, &st) == 0 && S_ISREG(st.st_mode))

multiuser != server

I've been in a couple of organizations where PCs were shared and thus 
had different users logging into them.  Cash registers and call

I just re-read PEP 3101, and it doesn't mention this behavior with None. 
  The way the code actually works is that the specifier is optional, and 
if it isn't present then it defaults to an empty string.  This behavior 
isn't mentioned in the PEP, either.

This feature came from a request from Talin[0].  We should either add 
this to the PEP (and docs), or remove it.  If we document it, it should 
mention the 2.x behavior (as other places in the PEP do).  If we removed 
it, it would remove the one place in the backport that's not just hard, 
but ambiguous.  I'd just as soon see the feature go away, myself.

The PEP actually mentions that this is how 2.x will have to work.  So 
I'll go ahead and implement it that way, on the assumption that getting 
string support into 2.6 is desirable.

IIUC, the 's' argument is the format specifier. Format specifiers are
written in a very conservative character set, so I'm not sure it
matters. Or are you assuming that the *type* of 's' also determines
the type of the output?

I may be in the minority here, but I think I like having a default for
's' (as implemented -- the PEP ought to be updated) and I also think
it should default to an 8-bit string, assuming you support 8-bit
strings at all -- after all in 2.x 8-bit strings are the default
string type (as reflected by their name, 'str').

I think it is. (But then I still live in a predominantly ASCII world.  :-)

For data types whose output uses only ASCII, would it be acceptable if
they always returned an 8-bit string and left it up to the caller to
convert it to Unicode? This would apply to all numeric types. (The
date/time types have a strftime() style API which means the user must
be able to specifiy Unicode.)

Yes, 's' is the format specifier.  I should have used its actual name. 
I'm am saying that the type of 's' determines the type of the output. 
Maybe that's a needless assumption for the builtin format(), since it 
doesn't inspect the value of 's' (other than to verify its type).  But 
for ''.format() and u''.format(), I was thinking it will be true (but 
see below).

It just seems weird to me that the result of format(3, u'd') would be a 
'3', not u'3'.

As long as it's defined, I'm okay with it.  I think making the 2.6 
default be an empty str is reasonable.

I live in that same world, which is why I started implementing this to 
begin with!  I've always been more interested in the ascii version for 
2.6 than for the 3.0 unicode version.  Doing it first in 3.0 was my way 
of getting it into 2.6.

I guess in str.format() I could require the result of format(obj, 
format_spec) to be a str, and in unicode.format() I could convert it to 
be unicode, which would either succeed or fail.  I think all I need to 
do is have the numeric formatters work with both unicode and str format 
specifiers, and always return str results.  That should be doable. As 
you say, the format specifiers for the numerics are restricted to 8-bit 
strings, anyway.

Now that I think about it, the str .__format__() will also need to 
accept unicode and produce a str, for this to work:

u"{0}{1}{2}".format('a', u'b', 3)

I'll give these ideas a shot and see how far I get.  Thanks for the 
feedback!

I've moved the PyImport_NotifyModuleLoaded() call to import_submodule().
It (should) guarantee that the hooks for a parent package is called
before the hooks for its children are called. I've analyzed the code
carefully enough to be sure but all unit test results are on my side.

On other words "import a.b.c" fires the hooks for "a", then "a.b" and at
last "a.b.c".

I could also modify imp.notify_module_loaded to accepts the module name
as string ("a.b.c."). If the module is provided by name (e.g. "a.b.c.")
rather than by object it makes sure that the hooks for "a", "a.b" and
"a.b.c" are called in the right order.

Would the modification fulfill your needs if
imp.notify_module_loaded("foo.bar.baz") call the hooks for "foo",
"foo.bar" and "foo.bar.baz" in that order?

The initial design used to set the hooks to None *after* the hooks were
called. I removed code yesterday because I thought it's not required.
Today I've re-added the checks for Py_None. I'm not setting the hooks to
Py_None before the hook are called.

Yes, that's the general idea.  But what happens if you are in the 
middle of firing hooks for 'a', and a new hook for 'a.b.c' is 
added?  What about a new hook for 'a'?

Well, it certainly can (and should) do the same if a module object is 
provided, since the module has a __name__.


>Would the modification fulfill your needs if
>imp.notify_module_loaded("foo.bar.baz") call the hooks for "foo",

Only if you can guarantee that no hook for a submodule is run until 
all the parent hooks are finished being called *and* that adding new 
callbacks while callbacks are being run will still call them... 
*after* any already-added callbacks.

In general, if you think something in peak.util.imports isn't 
required, you're probably wrong.  ;)


>I'm not setting the hooks to Py_None before the hook are called.

That's fine, but here's a different catch: are you iterating over the 
hooks by taking the length before you start?  If so, then hooks that 
are added *while* the hooks are being called back, will never get 
called, because they'll be added to the end of the list (and you'll 
never reach the end).  Make sure there's a test for that case.

peak.util.imports sets to None after callbacks, but it uses regular 
list iteration, so hooks can be added to the end of the list while 
the hooks are still being called.

An error while running the hooks should also set the hook list to 
None and discard all the hooks.  There isn't any sane way to recover 
from an error in a post-import hook.

Subject: [Python-Dev] distutils.cygwinccompiler: invalid executable for
	interpreters
Message-ID: <e2480c70801101433u567578acq328294965cbf3ee5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

Some time ago I've stumbled upon a problem with compiling py2exe with
mingw: it resulted in invalid executable run.exe. At first I dismissed
it as some very strange problem, but recently I decided to look into
it again and found that the reason for this is a .def file, supplied
during compilation, that causes linker to produce executable with
IMAGE_FILE_DLL in its PE Header Characteristics field, and operating
system refuses to execute it.

I traced this problem to the following block in distutils/cygwinccompiler.py:

        # handle export symbols by creating a def-file
        # with executables this only works with gcc/ld as linker
        if ((export_symbols is not None) and
            (target_desc != self.EXECUTABLE or self.linker_dll == "gcc")):

Removing 'or self.linker_dll == "gcc"' obviously helps. To me this
sounds like a bug (introduced in revision 17747 on trunk, more that 7
years old!), but I was wondering if there's any logic behind
generating a .def file for the executable (sidenote: look at
distutils/emxccompiler.py where .def file is generated for executables
only). To me it's very unlikely that anyone *ever* needs to export
symbols from an executable (I'm not even sure if it can work as
intended on Windows). Even then, if there's anyone at all who needs
such a machinery (again, what for?), at the very least it shouldn't
produce "LIBRARY" line. As minimal change as this:

            # Generate .def file
            contents = [
                "LIBRARY %s" % os.path.basename(output_filename),
                "EXPORTS"]
            if target_desc == self.EXECUTABLE:
                contents.pop(0)

Did the trick (generated executable runs fine).

Is anyone interested in a bug report for this? Also, is there any
chance that if there is interest it could end up in release25-maint?

Best regards,
Alexey.

Err, make that NOW, not NOT ... stupid typo.

I'm NOW setting the hooks to Py_None before the hooks are called.

it = iter(self.post_import_registry[name])
self.post_import_registry[name] = None
for hook in it:
    hook(module)

In my version a hook is immediately called when the the registry value
is set to None. When a hook is registered for a module during the
execution of the callback then the hook is fired directly and not after
the existing hooks are called. Is this a problem for you?

module "foo" is loaded:
hook1
hook2 -> registers hookX for "foo"
    hookX is called directly
hook3
hook4

The hooks are set to None even when an exception is raised by a hook.

If 'a' registers a new hook for a child of 'a' (e.g. 'a.b.c' or 'a.f')
then the new hooks are called with the remaining hooks for 'a.b.c':

import a.b.c
* hook_a1
* hook_a1 -> registers the hook_ab2 for 'a.b'
* hook_ab1 -> registers a hook_aX for 'a'
   hook_aX is fired immediately
* hook_ab2 -- the hook registered by hook_a1

Maybe I should add two methods to imp. One that calls the parent hooks
of a module automatically but relies on the existence of the parents and
the module in sys.modules.
And a second method which calls the hooks for a module object w/o
inspecting sys.modules.

Uhm, now it starts to become a mind bending problem. I may have to queue
and delay the registration of new hooks while other hooks are called by
the system. If an user registers a callback for 'a' while the callbacks
for 'a' are called than the registration is queued and the called after
the remaining hooks for 'a' are called. This could probably be
implemented by *not* setting the entry to None after I get hold of the
iterator but after the end of the iteration. iter() notices when a new
element is appended.

In the above sample can hook_aX be called after hook_ab1 or should it be
called after hook_ab2?

*g* ok. I'll check your implementation again.

Yes, because it violates the invariant that hooks for a given module 
are called in the same order that they were registered in.

In case you're wondering why it's a problem, it's because if a hook 
imports something that registers a hook, when previously that thing 
wasn't imported until later, all of a sudden your callback order is 
very different than what it was before.

More succinctly: if making small changes to your program can cause 
large differences in the result, it's hard to debug.  (Especially if 
you have no idea what 3rd party module changed its import order and 
messed things up.)

Believe me, it's a lot easier to debug if there is a globally 
understandable hook order, even if it's still a partial ordering.

Please check the changes and the new unit test in r59902 (
http://svn.python.org/view?rev=59902&view=rev ). Are you satisfied with
the ordering or do you think I should queue the hooks for already loaded
modules?

As I said above, calling the callbacks immediately is a problem, 
because it leads to significantly less predictability (and therefore 
control) of callback order.

This scenario isn't specific enough to produce/deduce the problem.

*sigh*.  We seem to be getting further and further off course, 
here.  The more different you make the semantics of the system, the 
harder it will be to verify that it's doing the right thing without 
having real field experience with the new approach.

Yep - that's precisely what peak.util.imports does, and is why it 
does it that way.

However, it has other ways of guaranteeing that the notification 
callback occurs only once, because the module object keeps track of that.


>In the above sample can hook_aX be called after hook_ab1 or should it be

That question can't be answered from the limited information you 
supplied about the scenario. What must not happen is that hook_aX 
must not be called before any *already-registered* hooks for 'a'.

I suspect that the whole thing was done to make sure that developers
of applications could:
    A: cope with stupidly long path names.
    V: cope with spaces in path names.

I bet they never intended to keep the huge names, just to make you cope
with them.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Passing contextual information when logging
Message-ID: <001101c8543e$fffa04e0$0800a8c0@DELTA>

I recently posted the following to c.l.py, and didn't get much feedback. I'm
planning to add a new class to the logging package, and before I do so I'd
like to get feedback from python-dev. I know many of the devs may not be
monitoring c.l.py, so I'm reposting here for your feedback.

Some users of the logging package have raised an issue regarding the
difficulty of passing additional contextual information when logging. For
example, the developer of a networked application may want to log, in
addition to specifics related to to the network service being provided,
information about the IP address of the remote machine and the username of
the person logged into and using the service.

Python 2.4 introduced an 'extra' keyword argument which was intended to hold
a dict-like object containing additional information to be added to a
LogRecord. The additional information would then be printed via placeholders
in a format string.

While this works, it is a little unwieldy to use in practice, because users
need to provide the 'extra' parameter in every logging call. This has led
people in some instances to create context-specific Logger instances (e.g.
one logger for every connection). This has a drawback in that a logger name
can only provide limited contextual information, and moreover, if the number
of connections is effectively unbounded over time, the number of Logger
instances will also grow in an unbounded way. (Logger instances are never
garbage collected, because references to them are always held in the logging
package. This alleviates a burden on users in that they never have to pass
loggers around, but means that creating a lot of Logger instances will lead
to a long-lived memory burden.)

One solution is to create a generic wrapper around loggers to which a logger
name and contextual information can be passed. The wrapper would delegate
logging calls to the logger with the specified name, but would manipulate
the arguments passed to the logging call to insert the contextual
information. I have created such a wrapper class, called LoggerAdapter,
which is in the example script located at

http://dpaste.com/30613/

I would welcome your views on whether the LoggerAdapter class is suitable
for adding to the logging package in Python 2.6/3.0. Does it do what might
reasonably be expected out of the box? LoggerAdapters are, of course,
garbage collected in the normal way and so impose no particular memory
burden.

I'll wait a few days for any comments/suggestions from this list, then
(assuming no adverse comments) go ahead and add the LoggerAdapter class and
update the docs.

Best regards,

Vinay Sajip

To elaborate on this a bit (and handwaving a lot of important details 
out of the way) do you mean something like the following for the builtin 
format?:

def format(obj, fmt_spec=None):
     if fmt_spec is None: fmt_spec=''
     result = obj.__format__(fmt_spec)
     if isinstance(fmt_spec, unicode):
         if isinstance(result, str):
             result = unicode(result)
     return result

Cheers,
Nick.

It looks pretty good (and useful) to me, but I have a couple of questions.

When you talk about stacking in the constructor docstring, do you mean 
something like having LoggerAdapterA delegating to LoggerAdapterB which 
in turn delegates to the real logger?

If that's what you mean, then I think the process() method will need to 
be changed to handle the case where there is already an "extras" entry 
in the keyword arguments. If that's not what you mean... then please 
explain because I don't have any other ideas :)

I was also going to suggest modifying the constructor to accept keyword 
arguments, but realised that case can be adequately handled just by 
using a dict:

   logger_with_extra = LoggerAdapter(logger, dict(attr1=5, attr2=True))

Cheers,
Nick.

Hi Nick,

Thanks for the feedback. The stacking is a bit of a corner case, so maybe I
should take that comment out of the docstring - but that's what I meant by
stacking. A set of stacked adapters could work by e.g. appending or prepending
their contextual info to the message, or by manipulating the "extra" keyword
argument to the base logger. The example implementation uses the "extra"
method, but if another adapter was to be stacked on top of that one, its
process method would need to check the passed in kwargs for key "extra" and
replace it with some merged version of the two sets of contexts - its own and
that of the underlying logger.

Another point about the "extra" method is that it lends itself to working with
a Formatter whose format string can hold user-defined placeholders like %(ip)s
in the example. This will work well in some scenarios, but in other scenarios
(where it may be desired to share formatters across various handlers, or
because stacking is desired and there's no way for one formatter to know all
the placeholders) it makes sense to just manipulate msg in the process method,
for example:

    def process(self, msg, kwargs):
        prefix = "IP: %(ip)-15s User: %(user)-8s" % self.extra
        return "%s %s" % (prefix, msg), kwargs

When I check it in I will elaborate on the class docstring to explain the usage
in a bit more detail, as well as of course detailing it in the docs in a
separate section entitled "Passing contextual information to the log" (or
similar).

Best regards,


Vinay Sajip

Thanks, I understand what you meant quite a bit better now. The comment 
didn't make a great deal of sense looking at the LoggingAdapter class in 
isolation, but is significantly more meaningful once you start 
discussing other possibilities for what can be done in the process() method.

I also like that the design of the class allows users to easily create 
their own adapters simply by subclassing this one and overriding the 
process() method. I imagine that's why you wrote it that way :)

Cheers,
Nick.

Isn't unicode idempotent? Couldn't

          if isinstance(result, str):
              result = unicode(result)


avoid repeating in Python a test already made in C by re-spelling it as

         result = unicode(result)

or have you hand-waved away important details that mean the test really 
is required?

That's the approach I'm taking.  The builtin format is the only caller 
of __format__ that I know of, so it's the only place this would need to 
be done.

This code is written in C.  It already has a check to verify that the 
return from __format__ is either str or unicode, and another check that 
fmt_spec is str or unicode.  So doing the conversion only if result is 
str and fmt_spec is unicode would be a cheap decision.

Good catch, though.  I wouldn't have thought of it, and there are parts 
that are written in Python, so maybe I can leverage this elsewhere.  Thanks!

Eric.

We should mark issues in the tracker that are good candidates for new

Does Roundup search also look at the text of the change notes added to

Yes, it does. Unfortunately, I've been using "bug day" in some
comments and that doesn't seem to work well in the search.

I think a keyword is easier, I can add it if you want me to.

Please add two keywords, one for bug day and one for easy tasks. May
"beginner task", "easy" or "novice level" makes a good keyword.

We could also mark complex/hard tasks, tasks which require C programming
and documentation only tasks, even though I'm not sure how useful the
additional tags would be.

I think marking easy tasks is all we need.  That would certainly be
useful during ongoing non-bugday development, but marking issues as
'bug-day' doesn't seem useful to me.  What would it mean?

Shouldn't documentation-only bugs be marked as being for the
'Documentation' component?  The C vs. Python requirement is also
discoverable from the component field, sort of; Library is for issues
in Lib/, which is all Python, and C extensions are the 'Extension
Modules' component.

This discussion has neither helping me nor you. Could you please write
an unit test or two to show me exactly what my implementation is doing
wrong and how you think the callbacks should be called. I know a simple
test won't proof the correctness of the implementation but a failing
test would at least show the incorrectness.

I'm still not sure which way is the correct way in your opinion and I
hate guessing what you are trying to explain to me.

Subject: [Python-Dev] PySequence_Concat for dicts
Message-ID: <3A374A5D-6019-4D32-A379-6636820DC009@northwestern.edu>

Hi all,

I am fairly new to the Python community so please forgive me (and  
correct me) if I am going about this wrong.

I think it would be convenient and pythonic if dict objects  
implemented the PySequence_Concat method. I see there was once a  
short-lived discussion about this here:

http://mail.python.org/pipermail/patches/2004-March/014323.html

I have also been following the discussion about contributing to  
Python. It seems to me that this would be a fairly easy feature to  
implement (perhaps naively?), and I would be glad to try writing a  
patch for this if there is at least some chance of it making it into  
one of the branches. Can someone please advise me on what the correct  
order for going about this would be? Do I need to first write a PEP  
justifying why I think it would be an improvement? Which version of  
Python (if any), should a patch be targeted at?

Otherwise, is there a good reason dicts do not already implement this  
method? I somewhat understand the complaint about commutativity, but  
as mentioned in the previous discussion, list concatenation is not  
commutative either. Seeing as update is the only builtin method for  
concatenation of dicts in the first place, it doesn't seem all that  
confusing that 'summing' two dicts should conveniently return a new  
instance that is the (only form of) concatenation of the two dicts.

regards,
jared

Subject: [Python-Dev] PEP: per user site-packages directory
Message-ID: <fm8u1g$7j1$1@ger.gmane.org>

MA Lemburg has suggested a per user site-packages directory in the
"pkgutil, pkg_resource and Python 3.0 name space packages" thread. I've
written a short PEP about it for Python 2.6 and 3.0.

PEP: XXX
Title: Per user site-packages directory
Version: $Revision$
Last-Modified: $Date$
Author: Christian Heimes <christian(at)cheimes(dot)de>
Status: Draft
Type: Standards Track
Content-Type: text/x-rst
Created: 11-Jan-2008
Python-Version: 2.6, 3.0
Post-History:


Abstract
========

This PEP proposes a new a per user site-packages directory to allow
users the local installation of Python packages in their home directory.


Rationale
=========

Current Python versions don't have an unified way to install packages
into the home directory of an user (except for Mac Framework
builds). Users are either forced to ask the system administrator to
install or update a package for them or to use one of the many
workaround like Virtual Python [1]_, Working Env [2]_ or
Virtual Env [3]_.

It's not the goal of the PEP to replace the tools or to implement
isolated installations of Python. It only implements the most common
use case of an additional site-packages directory for each user.

The feature can't be implemented using the environment variable
*PYTHONPATH*. The env var just inserts a new directory to the beginning
of *sys.path* but it doesn't parse the pth files in the directory. A
full blown site-packages path is required for several applications
and Python eggs.


Specification
=============

site directory (site-packages)

   A directory in sys.path. In contrast to ordinary directories the pth
   files in the directory are processed, too.


user site directory

   A site directory inside the users' home directory. An user site
   directory is specific to a Python version. The path contains
   the version number (major and minor only).

   Windows: %APPDATA%/Python/Python26/site-packages
   Mac: ~/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages
   Unix: ~/.local/lib/python2.6/site-packages


user configuration directory

   Usually the parent directory of the user site directory. It's meant
   for Python version specific data like config files.

   Windows: %APPDATA%/Python/Python26
   Mac: ~/Library/Python/2.6
   Unix: ~/.local/lib/python2.6

user base directory

   It's located inside the user's home directory. The user site and
   use config directory are inside the base directory. On some systems
   the directory may be shared with 3rd party apps.

   Windows: %APPDATA%/Python
   Mac: ~/Library/Python
   Unix: ~/.local


On Windows APPDATA was chosen because it is the most logical place for
application data. Microsoft recommands that software doesn't write to
USERPROFILE [5]_ and My Documents is not suited for application data,
too. [8]_

On Linux ~/.local/ was chosen in favor over ./~python/ because the
directory is already used by several other programs in analogy to
/usr/local. [7]_


Implementation
==============

The site module gets a new method adduserpackage() which adds the
appropriate directory to the search path. The directory is not added if
it doesn't exist when Python is started. However the location of the
user site directory and user base directory is stored in an internal
variable for distutils.

The user site directory is added before the system site directories
but after Python's search paths and PYTHONPATH. This setup allows the
user to install a different version of a package than the system
administrator but it prevents the user from accidently overwriting a
stdlib module. Stdlib modules can still be overwritten with PYTHONPATH.

distutils.command.install (setup.py install) gets a new argument
--user to install packages in the user site directory. The required
directories are created by install.

distutils.sysconfig will get methods to access the private variables
of site. (not yet implemented)

The Windows updater needs to be updated, too. It should create an menu
item which opens the user site directory in a new explorer windows.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

TBD


Open Questions
==============

* Are the directories for Windows, Mac and Unix fine?

* Mac: Should framework and non-framework builds of Python use the
  same directories?

* The patch also adds a usecustomize hook to site. Is it useful and
  should it stay?


Reference Implementation
========================

A reference implementation is available in the bug tracker. [4]_


Acknowledgments
===============

The implementation of this PEP, if accepted, is sponsored by Google
through the Google Summer of Code program.

I've added an "easy" keyword, with description "This is an easy task
(e.g. suitable for GHOP or bug day beginners)".

Let me know if more is needed, Andrew.

(I have no idea if anyone can add keywords or if I have magical
powers. On the left side bar there's a section "Administration" which

I'm unable to add new keywords although I've the developer role. I guess
one needs to be a coordinator to add new keywords.

IMO, the chainmap() recipe on ASPN is a much better solution since it doesn't create a third dictionary with the all the attendant allocation and copying effort. It isn't a common use case to need to sum two dictionaries while keeping both of the inputs unaltered.

I wasn't suggesting that the result of concatenation would be a  
chained table, rather that it would perform the equivalent of an  
update and return the new dict (the same way extend works for lists).

Inplace concatenation could be implemented more efficiently but would  
be exactly the same as calling update.

When does it come-up that you want a third summed dict 
while keeping the two originals around unchanged?  Does
it matter that the addition is non-commutative?  Would
a + b + c produce an intermediate a/b combo and then
another new object for a/b/c so that the entries in
a get copied twice and memory usage has to hold a, b,
a/b, c, and a/b/c in memory all at the same time?  
What are the use cases?

FWIW, the Py3.0 API for dicts will support some set-like
operations.  Perhaps, that fits the bill.

Very interesting!  Are you aware of Sage? http://sagemath.org.  All
Python-based, developed originally by a number theorist
(http://wstein.org), and with a rapidly growing team of developers
(including John Cremona, who's contributed a lot of his code to Sage).  

The Python-dev team should be proud of the impact Python is having in
scientific computing: python is without a doubt the leading tool for open
source, high-level scientific codes (i.e. not Fortran/C), and growing. 
Thanks!


I normally wouldn't announce this here, but please forgive the mini-spam

While that was at one point proposed, It's been retracted.

It does suggest that we have two choices for the proposed operation:
d1+d2 or d1|d2. I think the latter may be more appropriate:
len(seq1+seq2) == len(seq1) ++len(seq2), but no such invariant exists
for set union.

I'd like to take an "all or nothing" approach to this: either we
implement the same 4 operations as for sets (|, &, ^ and -) or we
implement none of them. We can assign semantics to these such that if
the values are all the same, these work the same as set operations on
the keys. E.g.:

  {1:1, 2:2} | {2:2, 3:3} == {1:1, 2:2, 3:3}
  {1:1, 2:2} & {2:2, 3:3} == {2:2}
  {1:1, 2:2} ^ {2:2, 3:3} == {1:1, 3:3}
  {1:1, 2:2} - {2:2, 3:3} == {1:1}

If the values differ, we have to decide what happens. For ^ and -, we
only need to take the keys into account. For | I propose that the RHS
wins, matching dict.update(); this makes sense since set.update() is
equivalent to |= for sets, so |= should match dict.update() for dict,
and then | follows. For & I'm on the fence, but I think it's easier to
say that the RHS wins in all cases. So we get:

  {1:1, 2:2} | {2:0, 3:0} = {1:1, 2:0, 3:0}
  {1:1, 2:2} & {2:0, 3:0} = {2:0}
  {1:1, 2:2} ^ {2:0, 3:0} = {1:1, 3:0}
  {1:1, 2:2} - {2:0, 3:0} = {1:1}

(The |=, &=, ^= and -= operators don't pose new problems, they update
the LHS in place.)

I'm not sure where I stand on this proposal -- I guess a +0, if
someone else does the work. (The abc.py module needs to be updated
too.)

I think this would end-up being clutter, something added
just because it could be done, not because we have compelling
use cases that can't be met with existing dicts, sets, and lists.

There is no way around it, this will be less efficient than the  
inplace operation. If there were a precedent for calling a method  
like update and returning itself instead of None, I would suggest  
that, but since this is the way that has already been established for  
lists, it seems a natural extension.

This might be way out there but I suppose you could consider that a  
dict is actually two different things, depending on what you are  
doing, and that these operations might actually do different things.  
Interpreted as a sequence, it is a sequence of key mappings. As  
confirmed in another recent discussion, Python guarantees consistent  
(read: repeatable) ordering of iteration through a dict, so in this  
sense it really is a sequence. (On a side note, I frequently rely on  
the repeatability of ordering when interacting with the Python shell).

The notable sequence operation being + for concatenation, would  
perform an update of the keys (thus for the sequence op the mappings  
aren't guaranteed to be preserved, only the keys).

The other interpretation of dict is obviously as a set of (key,  
value) pairs. For sets, the four major operations could behave  
exactly as any other set of (key, value) tuples (i.e. if you  
transform it to a list and then apply the same ops you should get the  
same result).

The minimum version is 2.6. 2.5 is in maintenance mode. Changes made to
2.6 are merged into 3.0 so you don't have to create two patches. It'd
stick to 2.6 because it's easy to port a 2.6 patch to 3.0, if the new
feature won't make it into 2.6.

Subject: [Python-Dev] inst_persistent_id
Message-ID: <A2A6D220-45A7-4C04-8D4E-CBBB919D55E1@zope.com>


Recently, I reviewed the documentation source for pickle and came  
across the following comment:

    BAW: Both pickle and cPickle support something called  
inst_persistent_id()
    which appears to give unknown types a second shot at producing a  
persistent
    id.  Since Jim Fulton can't remember why it was added or what it's  
for, I'm
    leaving it undocumented.

I couldn't remember this and decided to dig into it and realized that  
this was a very useful experimental feature I added way back when  
cPickle was in its infancy.  This is a fairly useful optimization that  
I never got around to evaluating.  (Yeah, I know.) It is a hook, like  
the persistent_id hook that is called with objects to determine if  
they should be pickled by persistent reference.  Unlike persistent_id,  
it isn't called for built-in types (really types for which pickle has  
specific handlers), like strings, numbers, lists, tuples and so on. It  
is only called for "instances" (types for which pickle doesn't have  
specific handlers).  This vastly reduces the number of calls to the  
hook.  Some tests with ZODB indicated significant improvements in  
pickling speed when a hook is used.

If there are no objections, I'll update the Python 2 documentation to  
describe this and add a test.  The comment above suggests that this  
hook is in pickle and cPickle.  It is in cPickle, but was removed from  
pickle.  I propose to add it back to pickle -- mainly for consistency  
with cPickle.  I'll need to double check how this interacts with the  
type dispatching in pickle protocol 2.

Any objections?

No, a dict is not a set of (key, value) pairs. The keys form a set,
you cannot have duplicate keys.

Not natural, just inefficient and cute.  Also, there was no answer
to the question about use cases.  AFAICT, this feature has never 
been requested.  The closest was a feature request for a
variant of update() that avoided overwrites when a duplicate
key was encountered -- Guido rejected that one a long time ago.

Your previous note suggests that there are alternative interpretations
of what the syntax could mean and that's not good a good thing.
That sort of ambiguity damages the language. It is not even
clear where the appropriate operators would be +-* or the
set operators &|^-.  How about we keep sets for set operations 
and dict for mapping operations and not foolishly conflate the two
just because we can.  The mapping API is central to the language.
Altering it should be approached with a great deal of care.

Also, the argument that we used + for lists so now we have
to do it for dicts is a weak one -- they are completely different animals.
Operators are not the solution to all problems.  In this case, we
don't even have a problem to be solved; there is just an urge
to hypergeneralize what was done for other datatypes where
it was appropriate.  The .update() method we have now is explicit, 
clear about its intent, and efficient.

IMO, the only thing this proposal has going for it is that it is cute.

Well, in Python 3K, inst_persistent_id() won't be usable, since
PyInstance_Type was removed. Adding (actually supporting) this feature
in Python 2.x will make it slightly harder to port code. So, I think
it would probably best to leave it as it is right now -- i.e.,
undocumented and unsupported.

By the way, you might be interested to look at my work on pickle [1]
for Python 3K. As part of last year Summer of Code, I removed the
differences between the Python and C implementation of pickle, and
thus allowing the C version to be transparently used, instead of the
Python one, when it is available. Currently, I am polishing the code
for inclusion into the main branch. I also started to work on the next
version of the pickle protocol, that will make it more suitable for
Python 3K. If you are interested to help out, just send me an email
and I will explain you what needs to be done.

+0.5  Thanks for writing this up as a PEP.

My main suggestion was going to be the ability to turn it off as you already
mentioned.  However, please consider leaving it off by default to avoid
problems for installed python scripts importing user supplied code.  For
shared hosting environments where this becomes really useful users can
easily add the -s (or whatever flag is chosen) to their programs
themselves.  I don't know what that'd mean on windows where #! lines don't
exist.  Yet another file extension to imply the flag (yuck)?  A .cmd wrapper
script to run python with the flag (ugh)?

For security reasons we also need it disabled when the getuid() != geteuid()
to avoid user supplied code being executed as another user.  Defaulting to
disabled would mean that security could be left up to the end user to mess
up.  (many systems do not allow setuid #! scripts but this issue would still
apply to things run under sudo)

During the discussion about the new Rational implementation
(http://bugs.python.org/issue1682), Guido and Raymond decided that
Decimal should not implement the new Real ABC from PEP 3141. So I've
closed http://bugs.python.org/issue1623 and won't be pursuing any of
the extra rounding methods mentioned on this thread.

+1 from me on implementing it and having it on by default for Windows.

Why do you think the user namespace overriding the system namespace be 
more of a problem for Windows than other platforms?

This would be a really useful feature for me and it would be a shame for 
it not to be on by default on Windows (and another set of complexities 
for setuptools I suspect).

Well, I didn't really decide anything. I suggested that if the
developers of Decimal preferred it, it might be better if Decimal did
not implement the Real ABC, and Raymond said he indeed preferred it.

Since this reduces the usefulness of numeric.Real, I'm somewhat
disappointed in this outcome (as I imagine you are). However, Decimal
has very little of my own sweat in it, and a lot of Raymond, Facundo
(and others, including Mark), and the ABC thing is still somewhat
experimental, so it wouldn't make sense for me to impose my ideas onto
Decimal unilaterally, and I'm sure Raymond etc. have their reasons.

So you prefer to make the per use site-package directory an opt-in
option? I prefer it as an opt-out option. It's enabled by default,
unless the user disables the feature with -s.

I'm not sure how to solve the problem on Windows. IMHO the feature
should be enabled on Windows at least but I like to keep it enabled on
all systems. The PEP doesn't add a new attack vector. The problem also
exist with PYTHONPATH. Paranoid programs should start with -E -s anyway
and paranoid system administrators can switch a flag in site.py:

# Enable per user site-packages directory
# set it to False to disable the feature or True to force the feature
ENABLE_USER_SITE = None

If we disable the feature by default it won't be available for a lot of
users.

It sounds like a reasonable and easy implementable idea, at least on
Unix. Windows doesn't have getuid() and geteuid(). On the other hand
Windows doesn't have the suid bit, too.

I also tried to check if os.stat(__main__.__file__).st_uid ==
os.getuid() but the real __main__ is not available in site.py. It's
loaded and assigned much later.

I'm also pretty confident it works, although it isn't really guaranteed to
catch *all* such situations. No reason not to backport it, just a remark
about how it checks to see if Python is shutting down. It is, however,
incredibly unlikely '_sys' won't be gone when we check for it if the
exception is indeed a spurious one. What could happen is that a legitimate
exception happens right before interpreter shutdown, then a thread switch
occurs before Python tries to report the exception, the interpreter exits,
and then the daemonic thread starts to report its exception. The only way to
catch that is to do the 'are we exiting' check in the C code that does the
actual thread-exception reporting. I'm not sure if it's worth it, as the
timing has to be pretty exact for that to happen, and you wouldn't want to
introduce a bug there; could be years before someone figures it out :P

The for loop has an else clause.

for x in A:
     if x % 2 == 0:
         print "even number found"
         break
else:
     print "no even numbers found"

Look at the new docs for 2.6 -- there's many more references in it.

print is a statement, and no function. () is an empty tuple, so
"print ()" prints an empty tuple.
(""), on the other hand, is the same as "".

There's a clear distinction between expressions and statements,
so it makes sense here too.

It would make more sense to redirect "criticism" out of beginners'
ignorance to comp.lang.python rather than spend time discussing their
misunderstandings here.

Is sys.argv[0] available at that point?

No, it's not available, too. The 'site' module is imported by
Py_Initialize(). sys.argv and the real __main__ module are set much
later in Modules/main.c.

What about the patch I initially presented (and which you originally  
dealt with)?

http://mail.python.org/pipermail/patches/2004-March/014323.html

It seems the original request just never discussed the issue of  
duplicate keys (for some odd reason).

It was foolish of me to make those comments, you're right, and I  
should have known better. Guido has made it clear that the correct  
interpretation is that the keys of a dict form a set, which gets rid  
of any ambiguity. The set operators are most appropriate, though I am  
not exactly clear on whether this is already going to be implemented  
in a future version of Python, or if its just that noone will object  
if it appears in a future version. If it is the latter, I would still  
like to take a stab at implementing this as a first contribution.  
Would you please advise?

I agree operators are not the solution to all problems (need they be  
the solution to any?). My argument about + for lists was merely based  
on the precedent it established for sometimes sacrificing efficiency  
for clarity. Sometimes you may not want to alter the original lists  
(just as sometimes you may not want to alter the original dicts), but  
even when it does not matter if you do, you might still write:

def prepend_with_a_b(list_a):
	return ['a', 'b'] + list_a

instead of

def prepend_with_a_b(list_a):
	list_b = ['a', 'b']
	list_b.extend(list_a)
	return list_b

Even though I suspect the latter will often be more efficient. The |  
operation for dict will not do anything that you could not otherwise  
do with update. I suspect most usage will be to simplify code as  
above. As for use cases when you actually want a new dict, I am  
guessing you do not want to know specifically why I don't want to  
alter dicts, but a more general use case, in which event the most  
generalized example is any case where you simply do not want to  
modify the original dicts.

Since it seems that you might not actually need convincing that  
having the 4 set operations supported would be a reasonable thing to  
do, I will stop here for now.

> IMO, the only thing this proposal has going for it is that it is cute.

I suppose I should be glad for that? I might have thought you to put  
that to its discredit. Anyhow, I am not sure if we are now in  
agreement or not, but if so would you please advise on how to proceed?

Sorry for misrepresenting you. I am a little disappointed, but if
we're right that numbers.Real is a good idea, then users will ask for
Decimal to implement it, and the Decimal developers can change their
minds in 3.1. Since I'm not one of those users, I'm not the right
person to argue for this anyway. :)

I haven't been watching the python-dev list for very long, so maybe
this has already been discussed ad nauseam (in which case, sorry),
but, from the devil's advocate-ish mathematics side of things, unless
numbers.Decimal is planned to be implemented with infinite precision
(which I doubt, but could not confirm with an admittedly small amount
of research), shouldn't it implement numbers.Rational instead?  Was
this ever discussed, or was it just assumed that numbers.Real was the
right decision?

Cheers,
Leif

Well, if nothing else, I'm certainly satisfied that my concerns about
accuracy are being addressed.  I will have to go read more of that
discussion.

I see where you're coming from.  My personal stance is that developers
_shouldn't_ think that way, but I know that's an unpopular opinion,
and isn't really worth discussion here.

I don't feel any pressing need to continue this here and now.

FWIW, I was looking into something similar but didn't proceed because it would break eval(repr(s)) == s as the constructor signature 
wants all the args in a tuple and won't accept keywords.  Still, I think what you did is a nice improvement.

Here's a couple more if you want to proceed down that path:

1. Have structseq subclass from PyTupleObject so that isinstance(s, tuple) returns True.  This makes the object usable whenever 
tuples are needed.

2. Add _fields, _asdict, and _replace to match the API in collections.namedtuple().  The _fields tuple should only include the 
visible positional fields while _asdict() and _replace() should include all of the fields whether visible or accessible only by 
attribute access.

Thanks for the nice work.

Hmm, is that really necessary? structseq has been in use for quite a
while and this need hasn't come up -- it's been designed to be quite
compatible with tuple *except* for isinstance checks, and that has
worked well.

I agree that eval(repr(s)) == s is nice to have but most complex object
don't support it. In this very case the readability of the repr() is
more important than eval(repr(s)). I'm sure lots of users still think
that os.stat or time.time() return an ordinary tuple.

I've turned your request into an issue: http://bugs.python.org/issue1820
It's a feasible yet challenging task for a new CPython coder.

It looks like that is the only difference, so subclassing from tuple won't
cause any other behavioral changes.  It looks like making it a subtype
involves only changing a few lines.  I think it can only help, especially
if we start to use structseq for more things in the future.  Also, I would
like the API to match collections.namedtuple() as closely as possible
so that there is just a single useful concept that gets applied whereever
needed.  The idea is basically that they *are* tuples with the added
nicity of attribute access and a self-documenting repr.

In addition, I would like to suggest that the current structseq usage
is changed to regular classes (perhaps with slots) in Python 3.
structseq was a compatibility mechanism for existing code that assumes
the things returned are tuples, when they are really objects with named
fields.

So for struct stat and struct tm in particular, I think the indexed
access should be removed in Python 3. Whether then structseq needs
to be preserved at all, I don't know.

Martin

So if I'm using the --user option, where would scripts be installed? 
Would this be:

Windows: %APPDATA%/Python/Python26/bin
Mac: ~/Library/Python/2.6/bin
Unix: ~/.local/lib/python2.6/bin

I'd like to be able to switch between several versions of my user 
installation simply by changing a link. (On the Mac I'm doing this by 
relinking ~/Library/Python to different directories.)

I doubt it; instead I think that, once Python 2.6 is released, the new
documentation system that's now at http://docs.python.org/dev/ will
move up to become the top page of docs.python.org, and /dev/ will remain
the trunk version, updated daily.

Various links on the top page of docs.python.org have become outdated,
though; I've gone through the page and updated or removed them.

I read his objections slightly differently.

He is very clear that Decimal itself should be restricted to the
standard, and therefore should not natively implement the extensions.
But he also said that it might be reasonable for another package to
subset or superset it in a friendlier way.

numbers.py is a different module, which must be explicitly imported.

If the objection is that

    >>> decimal.Decimal("43.2").imag

would work (instead of throwing an exception) only when numbers.py has
already been imported, then ... well, that confusion is inherent in
the abstract classes.

Or is the problem that it *still* wouldn't work, without help from the
decimal module itself?  In that case, 3rd party registration is fairly
limited, and this might be a good candidate for trying to figure out
ABCs and adapters *should* work together.

The thing is:

http://www.python.org/ has a link Documentation, which links to
http://www.python.org/doc/ and from there has a link with Browse Current
Documentation to http://docs.python.org/ - it's kind of confusing with the
Quick Links content at the bottom. You have two choices in the left-hand side
menu that both read Documentation. That's ambiguous.
Add to that that the stylesheet between www.python.org and docs.python.org are
different and the menu structure is also different and it makes for a bad user
experience. And to make matters even more confusing docs.python.org/dev/ has
its own stylesheet as well.

Great work, all in all, but this is bad style (pun intended).

I wonder if a mix between www.python.org's stylesheet and
docs.python.org/dev/'s can be made. The colours of www.python.org's headers
and the links are too similar in colour, plus the dotted line beneath the URL
disappears against the white background. In that aspect docs.python.org/dev/
is a step up.

I think the relevant link to change here would be ~/.local.

I have personally been using the ~/.local convention for a while, and I 
believe ~/.local/bin is where scripts should go.  Python is not the only 
thing that can be locally installed, and the fact that it's 
~/.local/lib/python2.6/site-packages  suggests that ~/.local has the 
same layout as /usr (or /usr/local, for those who use that convention).

There seems to be a use case for it still, otherwise
collections.namedtuple wouldn't be added to 2.6, right? I agree that
it's time to clean up the tuple-ness of the stat and tm structures
(especially since they both may have "hidden" fields that are not
accessible via the tuple structure). And I see no need for the new
sys.flags object to be a tuple at all.

Looking at the code, inst_persistent_id() is just a confusing name.  It
has got nothing to do with PyInstance_Type; it's called for any object
type that cPickle.c doesn't know how to handle.  In fact, it seems that
cPickle.c never calls inst_persistent_id() for objects of type
PyInstance_Type...

Hi,
Today I received a report from a guy who tried to run the test suite
of a module of mine.
The test suite uses the test module for running tests, for temporary
files support and for doing a bunch of other things.
He tested it on CentOS 5 and looks like python 2.5.1 includes the test
module but python 2.4.3 does not:

[root at dell test]# python2.4 test_ftpd.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test_ftpd.py", line 37, in ?
    from test import test_support
ImportError: No module named test

Another guy reported the same thing by having tried to run the test
suite against a Windows mobile OS equipped with PythonCE 2.4 where the
test module seems to be not available too.

I was wondering if there was someone aware of this problem.

~/.local/bin or ~/bin ?

~/bin is the standard directory for user binaries. I can see how
~/.local/bin follows the idea of other directories. But ~/bin is more
convenient than ~/.local/bin. I don't want to teach users how to change
their .bashrc or .profile file for ~/.local/bin. A line like

if [ -d ~/bin ]; then
    PATH=~/bin:$PATH
fi

is in most .profile files (often commented out).

I'm proposing ~/bin for Unix (including Mac) and
%APPDATA%/Python/Scripts for Windows. The Windows installer could then
add the directory to the PATH environment and install a minimal bat file
"@C:\Python26\python.exe %*" as python26.bat, too.

Well, to me that sounds like idolizing the standard. The standard
exists so as to ensure that decimal numbers have well-understood
semantics that are implemented correctly. I don't think the standard
was ever meant to exclude optimal interaction with the rest of a
language. I'd like to see if ReXX implements numeric features over and
above the standard.

Fortunately, the confusion is in your mind only, because that's not
how ABCs work according to PEP 3119. While as a side effect of
importing the numbers module, the Decimal class might become a virtual
subclass of numbers.Real, that doesn't mean that implementation
features are automatically added. The registration that might take
place inside numbers.py *only* affects the outcome of isinstance() and
issubclass() checks -- it doesn't magically add missing attributes or
methods to the class.

Right.

Of course 3rd party registration is limited -- there's no way that you
could automatically define the right semantics, since the ABCs don't
have a way to express semantics.

PEP 3119 is meant as a *first step* towards adopting ABCs as a core
feature. The changes added to collections.py and numbers.py are best
considered as minimal examples. The main achievement of the PEP is
probably the hooks that allow you to override isinstance() and
issubclass(), plus the decision (which was discussed at length) to use
ABCs (with virtual inheritance), not interfaces, to model similarities
between class APIs.

Correct. We don't need item access anymore. However the struct seq
should still be slice-able for functions like time.mktime().

The test *package* is much older than Python 2.4, but many Python
distros exclude it from their default configuration. Perhaps there is
a way to add it back; on many Linux-based systems running apt-get or
yum with the appropriate arguments is all it takes. Sorry, I can't
help you with the appropriate parameters, since every distro does it
differently.

Oh, that's a good point. I think it actually doesn't make sense for it
to be sliceable without behaving like a sequence in all (or most)
aspects.

I don't think this applies to struct stat though; I can never remember
the order of the values there, unlike the first 6 of a time tuple,
which have an obvious order.

Good to know, thanks for the information.
I didn't know that python-tests were treated as a separate package on
certain platforms.
As replacement I'll use unittest.main() for running tests and a static
string defined by me instead of test.test_support.TESTFN.

"the" standard directory?  according to what?  commented-out examples in 
some linux distribution?

I think consistency is important here.  Python is not the only tool that 
could follow this convention, and it would be nice to have a consistent 
convention that it would be easy for other tools and environments to 
adopt.

as you say, it is often commented out.  You have to teach users this 
anyway, even if sometimes it will work by accident.

~/bin comes from the convention of "./configure --prefix=$HOME", as 
autoconf suggests.  This means users must have visible directories in 
their home folder named (among other things) "bin", "share", "lib", 
"src", "sbin", "man", and "include".  I find this ugly.  I only find it 
slightly less ugly that Python will now hide its locally-installed 
library files from me but not its locally-installed executable scripts.

"./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local" will instead put things into 
~/.local/bin, ~/.local/lib, etc.

Now, I am aware that setup.py already has a special "--home" option, and 
it can be incompatibly changed, but I don't see a reason for this.  Note 
that --home $HOME will currently put files into ~/lib, not ~/.local/lib. 
(and --home $HOME/local will put scripts into ~/.local/bin, not ~/bin).

But, now that I've told you what I think in more detail, unless you like 
my ideas and have specific questions, I will try to refrain from 
commenting further, lest I dig my own bike shed here :).

I should be more carefully when I use the word "standard".

I have no strong opinion on ~/bin or ~/.local/bin. I understand your
point of view and I concur with some of your arguments.

I'm making this discussion point easy for me. I let the others decide!
:) I don't feel like wasting my time on a bike shed discussion unless

I feel pretty strongly that ~/bin should *not* be used.  It makes  
sense to me that ~/.local would mirror /usr/local.

Two votes for ~/.local/bin and one undecided PEP author ... I'm changing
the code to ~/.local/bin and I'm adding a new section to the PEP.

Can I just submit the PEP or do I have to follow a procedure before I
can add it to the PEP list?

You can submit the PEP and update PEP 0 (note that each PEP occurs
twice!) but you can't mark it "accepted" :-)

Perhaps; I'm not strongly opposed to keeping structseq. I'll
work on making stat_result and struct_time regular fixed-size types,
for 3.0.

Thanks for the effort, Christian. Much appreciated.

Regarding the recent ~/bin vs. ~/.local/bin discussion:

I usually maintain my ~/bin directories by hand and wouldn't want
any application to install things in there automatically (and so far
I haven't been using any application that does), so I'd be
in favor of the ~/.local/bin dir.

Note that users typically don't know which scripts are made
available by a Python application and it's not always clear
what functionality they provide, whether they can be trusted,
include bugs, need to be run with extra care, etc, so IMHO
making it a little harder to run them by accident is well
warranted.

Thanks again,

Well, mktime() assumes its argument to be a tuple, and there are
plenty of places that either emulate its API (like calendar.timegm())
or provide a tuple for it. I wouldn't want to lose the ability to
manually construct a tuple to go into mktime() and friends.

Oh, you are right. I thought that save_inst() used inst_persistent_id,
but that isn't the case. Now, I have checked more thoroughly and found
the relevant piece of code:

	if (!pers_save && self->inst_pers_func) {
		if ((tmp = save_pers(self, args, self->inst_pers_func)) != 0) {
			res = tmp;
			goto finally;
		}
	}

which is indeed called only when the object is not "supported" by pickle.

I guess my original argument doesn't hold anymore, thus I don't have
anything against supporting this feature officially.

Thanks for correcting me!

But what about the slicing? AFAICT, mktime doesn't support "short"
tuples.

mktime could continue to support tuples (including manually created
ones), yet struct_time could still be a proper class, as long as mktime
accepts that as well.

Whereas ~/bin is something I am quite familiar with.

One thing I miss in this PEP and discussion is the point of view from a
webhosting company and webhosting user.

If the webhoster upgrades his hosting software and Python get updated by a
revision (say 2.5 to 2.6) this would in the current case mean that the
webhosting user using per-user site-packages is out of luck due to the
hard-wired (and apparently needed) version identifier. Or is that a wrong
assumption on my side?

Right now Python faces a lot of problems in the webhosting world because it's
tedious to set up and maintain for the webhosting user since they often have
to compile and install their own Python in their home directory. The per-user
site-packages will help in that aspect a lot, I think, but we do need to
detail some more use-cases and scenarios (patterns if you like) on how such
deployments would work.
I think this is extremely important due to the proliferation of Python now
more and more as a choice for webapp development.

The problem exists for almost every Python extension. 3rd party packages
with C modules have to be compiled for every Python version. Even pure
Python packages don't always work on a new version. You can't expect
software to run under every version of FOO, not even the next future
version of FOO where FOO is Python, Java, C#, Perl, PHP ... you name it.

It's not the intention of the PEP to solve the problem. A web hoster can
support multiple versions of Python at once. You can install every minor
version of Python from 2.0 to 3.0 (8 versions) without major conflicts.
A *good* web hoster should give an user several months up to a year to
migrate from - say - 2.5 to 2.6. Most Linux distributions (except
Redhat) have at least 2.4 and 2.5 in their repositories.

Can you write up some use cases for us? I'm especially interested in use
cases that are not covered by PEP 370. So far only a few problems come
into my mind:

* Installation extensions for mod_python, requires root permissions
  or full control over the Apache process anyway

* Multiple versions of an extension. The problem is mostly covered
  by pkg_resources and setup tools.

* Installing a newer version of an extension, covered by PEP 370.

* Registering more search paths. Drop a pth file into the user site
  directory or use a usercustumize.py.

* easy_install packages to the user site directory. Setuptools are not
  part of the Python stdlib. I'm confident that Phil is going to add
  the feature as soon as the feature is implemented for Python 2.6

What's missing?

Never heard of it either, would be completely baffled if caught unawares by
it in the wild.  Has anyone consulted with the LSB or a cross-platform
filesystem layout guide to see what the recommended best-practice is?

Message-ID: <ca471dc20801150737s373087c0y41300794b95c2afc@mail.gmail.com>

I ran into the need of monkeypatching a large number of classes (for
what I think are very good reasons :-) and invented two new recipes.
These don't depend on Py3k, and the second one actually works all the
way back to Python 2.2. Neither of these allows monkeypatching
built-in types like list. If you don't know what monkeypatching is,
see see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch.

I think it's useful to share these recipes, if only to to establish
whether they have been discovered before, or to decide whether they
are worthy of a place in the standard library. I didn't find any
relevant hits on the ASPN Python cookbook.

First, a decorator to add a single method to an existing class:

def monkeypatch_method(cls):
    def decorator(func):
        setattr(cls, func.__name__, func)
        return func
    return decorator

To use:

from <somewhere> import <someclass>

@monkeypatch_method(<someclass>)
def <newmethod>(self, args):
    return <whatever>

This adds <newmethod> to <someclass>

Second, a "metaclass" to add a number of methods (or other attributes)
to an existing class, using a convenient class notation:

def monkeypatch_class(name, bases, namespace):
    assert len(bases) == 1, "Exactly one base class required"
    base = bases[0]
    for name, value in namespace.iteritems():
        if name != "__metaclass__":
            setattr(base, name, value)
    return base

To use:

from <somewhere> import <someclass>

class <newclass>(<someclass>):
    __metaclass__ = monkeypatch_class
    def <method1>(...): ...
    def <method2>(...): ...
    ...

This adds <method1>, <method2>, etc. to <someclass>, and makes
<newclass> a local alias for <someclass>.

I've expressed this one before as "class someclass(reopen(someclass)):", 
but have thankfully never needed to actually use that in a real program. 
It's been a helpful tool in explaining to overzealous Ruby-ists that 
"reopenable" classes are not as unique as they think.

My feelings on monkeypatching is that it *should* feel a little gross 
when you have to do it, so the code I've written that does 
monkeypatching for real is generally a bit ugly.

Yes, monkeypatching should never be formalized to the point where 
novices see it as other than a tool of last resort. Otherwise a user 
base will grow that uses monkeypatching instead of subclassing, for 
example (shudder).

when_imported('a.b')(func_ab1)
when_imported('a.b')(func_ab2)

@when_imported('a')
def func_a1(module_a):
     when_imported('a.b')(func_ab3)
     notify_module('a.b')   # <- this is here to foil trivial implementations

when_imported('a')(func_a2)
notify_module('a.b')

This should produce the calling sequence:

func_a1, func_a2, func_ab1, func_ab2, func_ab3.



>I'm still not sure which way is the correct way in your opinion and I
>hate guessing what you are trying to explain to me.

The invariants to ensure are:

1. notification is only done once for a given module, ever, even if 
the notification function is called more than once, even if it's 
called during notifications for that module

2. notifications for a child module/package may not begin until the 
notifications for the parent package have begun

3. two registrations for the same module must always be invoked in 
the same order as they were registered, even if some of the 
registrations are done during notification.

In order to implement these invariants, you will have to have a way 
to know whether notifications have been begun for a given module.  In 
peak.util.imports, the module objects effectively keep track of this, 
although they don't have a specific flag.  For the Python 
implementation, you could add a __notified__ field to module objects, 
and implement the notify function thus:

     def notify(name):
         try:
             module = sys.modules[name]
         except KeyError:
             raise ImportError("Module %s has not been imported" % (name,))
         if module.__notified__:
             return
         if '.' in name:
             notify(name[:name.rfind('.')])
         try:
             module.__notified__ = True
             for callback in post_import_hooks[name]:
                callback(module)
         finally:
             post_import_hooks[name] = None

Of course, __notified__ would actually be a structure slot, rather 
than an attribute, so as to avoid any attribute lookup issues with 
module subtypes (e.g. lazy modules).

The register function would simply append a hook to the entry in 
post_import_hooks if it's not None, or call the hook otherwise.

With this implementation, I could make a version of peak.util.imports 
that did its own lazy modules, but used the base system for all the hooks.

I like it, but my first thought was, "and if that method already
exists?" I'd extend monkeypatch_method to store a reference to the old
method(s):

    def monkeypatch_method(cls):
        """Add the decorated method to the given class; replace as
needed.
        
        If the named method already exists on the given class, it will
        be replaced, and a reference to the old method appended to a
list
        at cls._old_<name>. If the "_old_<name>" attribute already
exists
        and is not a list, KeyError is raised.
        """
        def decorator(func):
            fname = func.__name__
            
            old_func = getattr(cls, fname, None)
            if old_func is not None:
                # Add the old func to a list of old funcs.
                old_ref = "_old_%s" % fname
                old_funcs = getattr(cls, old_ref, None)
                if old_funcs is None:
                    setattr(cls, old_ref, [])
                elif not isinstance(old_funcs, list):
                    raise KeyError("%s.%s already exists." %
                                   (cls.__name__, old_ref))
                getattr(cls, old_ref).append(old_func)
            
            setattr(cls, fname, func)
            return func
        return decorator

I chose a renaming scheme somewhat at random. The list allows you (or
someone else ;) to call monkeypatch repeatedly on the same cls.method
(but it's not thread-safe).

And although it might seem to be making monkeypatches easier to perform,
at least it's very explicit about what's going on as long as you keep
"monkeypatch" in the name.

I use ~/local, with a layout analogous to /usr, all the time. It's not
a standard, but in my experience it is by far the best solution to
installing things in the home directory. It doesn't matter much
whether you call it local or .local or .pythonlocal (although that
last would limit the utility somewhat, by implying that other things
should be installed there). It does matter that it be a _subdirectory_
of ~, and that it be structured like /usr.

To those folks who favor creating ~/bin, ~/lib, ~/share, ad nauseum, I
point out that non-hidden, non-user-created files in ~ ought to be
kept to a minimum. It is, after all, the user's default workspace.

Agreed.  You're just asking for trouble if you set --prefix=$HOME.
Eventually you will encounter some package which would have scribbled all
over /usr/local and only disrupted other external packages (which you can
always reinstall) but instead scribbles all over your home directory, wiping
out your almost finished Ph.D. thesis in Library Science which you had saved
to ~/lib.

But only to people who have demonstrated that they already know when,
why and how to monkeypatch on their own.  Lisp's `defadvice' plays a
starring role in a number of my nightmares.  Most recently, 15 minutes
ago.<wink>

Come to think of it, `defadvice' does have the advantage that it also
automatically monkeypatches the docstring to say "This function has
<class> advice", and with a little cooperation from the advisor can
also provide documentation of the changed semantics.

My implementation calls the hooks in the right order but I had to insert
fake modules into sys.path.

        # insert the modules into sys.modules to fake a 3rd party import
        a = imp.new_module('a')
        ab = imp.new_module('a.b')
        a.b = ab
        sys.modules["a"] = a
        sys.modules["a.b"] = ab
        # notify
        imp.notify_module_loaded('a.b')

Otherwise the code fails to fetch the module objects from sys.path and
an exception is raised.

The latter is not yet implemented. notify_module('a.b') currently fails
with a recursion limit exceeded. It's on my todo list.

This is already implemented for notification by name but not for
notification by module object. It's also on my todo list.

I'm pretty but not yet absolute sure that my implementation guarantees
the last invariant. I've to go through my code several times and play
through use cases.

That's a nice idea to fix the recursion issue with nested notifications.

Sure, I can use a slot for PyModule and its subclasses. Unfortunately
other implementations of lazy imports are adding a proxy object which is
not a subclass of PyModule. I've to use an attribute if not
isinstance(mod, moduletype).

> The register function would simply append a hook to the entry in

My code queues up new hooks while a sequence of hooks is processed. It
makes sure that hooks for a parent aren't called in the middle of a
child's hook chain.

notification_in_progress = False
queue = []

def register_hook(hook, name):
    if notification_in_progress:
        queue.append((hook, name))
        return

    hooks = sys.post_import_hook_register(name, None)

    if hooks is None:
        module = sys.modules.get(name, None)
        if modules:
            sys.post_import_hook_register[name] = None
            hook(module)
        else:
            hooks = []
            sys.post_import_hook_register[name] = hooks

    hooks.append(hook)

def notify_loaded(mod_or_name):
    notification_in_progress = True
    try:
        ...
    finally:
        notification_in_progress = False
        while queue:
            hook, name = queue.pop(0)
            hook(sys.modules[name])

I don't understand why they *have* to do that. I can believe they do
that as they don't know better - but why can't they use the Python
interpreter already available on the system, and just install additional
packages in their home directory?

For that, I think the requirements need to be much more explicit.

To me, this strongly suggests user configuration files, not a place
where an app can store user-specific packages.

True, there are apps that store their stuff in such places, like most
GNOME apps.  But they have no user-servicable parts (including config
files) anyway.

I think both for UI reasons (given above) and for API reasons (given
by others) there should be a separate ~/SOMETHING/{bin,etc,lib,share}
hierarchy for user-specific packaged contents.  I like ~/.local a

   Having ~/.python allows me remove it with just one command. It's harder
to clear ~/.local/{bin,lib} without affecting whatever I want to preserve
there.

Indeed it is. I guess my only innovation is realizing that you don't
have to create a real metaclass -- you can set __metaclass__ to a
function that does the magic. I like your feature of refusing
overrides unless flagged with @replace.

I think that despite the objection that monkeypatching shoudn't be
made too easy, it's worth at looking into a unification of the API,
features, and implementation.

Notice that that's not necessary with the notification algorithm I 
gave, since the list in post_import_hooks suffices as a queue.  So, 
just as in peak.util.imports, the registration code doesn't need to 
know whether callbacks are being run; it only needs to know whether 
they're *finished*.

Of course, both the notification and registration functions must hold 
the import lock to prevent a race condition where one thread adds a 
hook to the list after another thread has just finished iterating 
over it and is about to replace the list with None.  At least, they 
have to if they're executing any Python code that might cause the GIL 
to be released.  The callbacks will release the GIL, of course, but 
the registration code probably doesn't...  well, it will if it calls 
the hook, and ISTM that the hooks should always execute with the 
import lock held, even if they're fired at registration.

I'm curious: has this affected your thoughts re: overloading existing 
functions? Note that overloading-in-place would provide the 
next_method idiom for calling the original function.

(I'm assuming you still don't like the idea of changing a function's 
code to do it, just wondering about the non-implementation aspect.  :) )

Not really -- I'm still thinking of a class as something with public
internal structure while I think of a function as something with
private internal structure (except for function attributes settable in
its __dict__).

While I have you, I've come across a need that I don't know how to do
with GFs. Suppose I have a GF that implements some recursive function
over container types, e.g. serialization or flattening. Now suppose
I'd like to create *another* GF that implements the same algorithm
except it does something different for one particular type; as a
concrete example, suppose we want to treat tuples atomically when
flattening. Is there a way to reuse the work of the first GF? It
doesn't work to create a new GF that calls on the first GF for types
it doesn't understand; e.g. a list could contain a tuple. Does your GF
machinery let me do this in a relatively clean way? (I think of it as
"subclassing" a GF, where I think of the GF as a class that has a
method for each supported type. If GFs were implemented this way, I
could simply subclass it and override the method for tuples.) You
might want to change the subject if you care to respond.

No, it shouldn't be.  Part of the implementation should be a way for
user-specific packages to uninstall themselves.  It's also not clear
to me how you can "just remove" ~/.python if there is more than one
package installed there.

Yes.  RuleDispatch actually has a 'clone()' feature for 
single-dispatch generics that does exactly what you're looking for:

http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/VisitorRevisited

(see the heading "Extension and Reuse").

It's probably not a bad idea to put a cloning feature on my extended 
to-do list for PEAK-Rules.

In PEAK-Rules (the system after which PEP 3124 was modelled), a 
generic function has a RuleSet that contains its rules, and RuleSets 
can be subscribed to.  So, you could create a listener that 
automatically takes the rules added to one function and adds them to others.

It's not packaged as a convenient decorator or anything, but one 
certainly could make one.  It'd also need to have some way to ensure 
that the rules from the original function were treated at a lower 
combination precedence than anything else, but that could be handled 
by with a custom method type pretty easily, I think.

All in all, a cloning feature might be somewhere around 20-50 lines 
of code to add in -- and a third party could probably roll their own 
without changing PEAK-Rules' source.

It's relatively clean.  One of my goals for the changed architecture 
in PEAK-Rules vs. RuleDispatch was to make it possible to do all 
sorts of things like this, by opening up the whole thing to extensibility.

Btw, a lot of the credit for PEAK-Rules' design goes to you, in a 
roundabout way.  Your tuple-of-types prototype made me see that it 
could be practical to implement generic functions using generic 
functions as a base -- getting rid of interfaces and adaptation 
altogether.  I just needed to come up with a design that allowed 
separating the genericness of a function (e.g. the rules to be 
applied) from the implementation of genericness (the "engine" that 
turns rules into executability.

In this way, a generic function can start out using just tuples of 
types, but then graduate to a full expression-based system, just by 
changing the engine.

Are you sure your proposed algorithm and output match for the test case?
I'm confident I got it right in C but I'm getting a different output.

Without the extra imp.notify_module_loaded('a.b') in func_a1(mod)::

   ['func_a1', 'func_a2', 'func_ab1', 'func_ab2', 'func_ab3']


With the extra imp.notify_module_loaded('a.b') in func_a1(mod)::

   ['func_a1', 'func_ab1', 'func_ab2', 'func_ab3', 'func_a2']

I can't see how your implementation results in the first output when
func_a1() calls the notification method.

I'm aware of the implications and my code already uses the lock. The
PyImport_NotifyLoaded() method excepts to be called with the importer
lock acquired. So I'm locking the importer lock in
imp_notify_module_loaded(). The PyImport_RegisterPostImportHook() method
does the locking before it accesses sys.modules and sys.post_import_hooks.

I guess it's not right then.  ;-)  Though I shouldn't make fun, since 
it turns out that my code sketch was not a correct translation of 
peak.util.imports.  (See below.)

Right - that's why I put it in there, to foil trivial implementations 
that don't really satisfy the invariant.


>I can't see how your implementation results in the first output when
>func_a1() calls the notification method.

Hm, you're right, my implementation sketch waits too long to set the 
__notified__ flag.  It should have read:

      def notify(name):
          try:
              module = sys.modules[name]
          except KeyError:
              raise ImportError("Module %s has not been imported" % (name,))
          if module.__notified__:
              return
          try:
              module.__notified__ = True
              if '.' in name:
                  notify(name[:name.rfind('.')])
              for callback in post_import_hooks[name]:
                 callback(module)
          finally:
              post_import_hooks[name] = None

That is, module.__notified__ has to be set *before* the recursive 
notification call.  This effectively happens in peak.util.imports 
now, except that __notified__ isn't an explicit attribute, just a 
side effect of other module state changes.

Sure, but it's clearly where this should be on an OS X system, by
default.  And I'm sure there's a different "best place" on Windows
(for instance, all of our accounts are network roaming accounts, and
you don't want to put anything in ~).  And there are probably various
right places for various flavors of Linux.

Any PEP on this that doesn't take these OS-specific differences into
account probably isn't worth reading, IMO.

Your comment doesn't help at all. In fact my proposal uses different
"best places" for Windows (%APPDATA%), Mac (~/Library/Python) and Unix
(~/.local). I can't comment on OS2, Ricos and VAX because I've zero
experience with the platforms.

The right place for a platform is the place we decide is right. As long
as the directory is somewhere inside the home directory of a user and
the directory doesn't show up in the user data folder (hence APPDATA on
Windows and a dot directory on Unix) I consider any sensible directory
as the right one. Do you think APPDATA. ~/Library/Python or ~/.local are
not sensible?

Please stop bitching and bring in some useful, constructive criticism
and use cases not covered by my PEP. Have you read the PEP at all?

It's done. Your proposed test cases passes together with my tests. The

Sorry about that - as I said, __notified__ is very much an implicit 
thing in peak.util.imports.

And I believe I've also mentioned a lot of times how hard it is to 
get this stuff right...  :)

Congrats!  Now all we need to do is get the authors of other lazy 
import/export/whatever systems to chime in with whatever additional 
invariants *they* might need...  ;-)

Oh, no! You are kidding me ... But yes that's "all" we need to do. And
I've to update the patch and explain why the implementation does all the
crazy stuff.

I think only for stuff that is a Mac-ish GUI app type of thing and/or that

that's just me.

Is that really the question?  I'd agree with you there.  But if you
wanted a standard per-user place where gcc would look for custom
filters of some sort, on OS X, I'd think it would be appropriate.
Which makes more sense, to me, as an analogue of a per-user
site-packages directory.

I posted this on c.l.py but I didn't get a definite answer so I am
asking again here: is it documented anywhere that "from
.relative.module import *' is syntax error? Unless I missed it, PEP
328 doesn't mention anything about it. Also, while I understand the
general caveats and warnings against "import *", at first glance it
seems inconsistent to disallow it for relative imports while it is
valid for absolute. Are there any particular reasons that allowing
relative '*' imports is harder to implement, more fragile or generally
worse in some way ?

Doesn't Apple publish standards for this?  They do for everything

Subject: [Python-Dev] PEP 370, open questions
Message-ID: <478F0A07.5040406@cheimes.de>

The PEP 370 (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0370) "per user site
packages directory" has several open questions:

* Are the directories for Windows, Mac and Unix fine?
* Mac: Should framework and non-framework builds of Python use
  the same directories?
* The patch also adds a usecustomize hook to site. Is it useful and
  should it stay?
* Should the site package directory also be ignored if process
  gid != effective gid?
* Should the Windows installer add %APPDATA%/Python/Scripts to PATH?
* Should the base directory be configurable with an environment
  variable like PYTHONUSERHOME?

A CC of the mail goes to the authors of setuptools, virtual python,
working env and virtual env. What's your opinion on the PEP? Do you have
some input and advice for me?

The Windows installers currently do not add the main Python\Scripts
directory to PATH, so they shouldn't add this one either.

I wrote a similar tool called Combinator 
(http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodCombinator) which Divmod uses quite 
intensively.  I think a significant portion of the Twisted community 
also uses it for development.  Luckily you don't need to CC me specially 
as I'm here already ;-).  One of the features it provides is a user 
site-packages directory much in the same style that the PEP proposes, so 
I'll comment on my experiences maintaining it.
>The PEP 370 (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0370) "per user site

One of the problems we've encountered over and over again with 
Combinator is that MacOS has a dual personality.  Its personality is not 
just an issue of framework vs. non-framework build, but a fundamental 
question of "is this platform a UNIX or is it not a UNIX".

An example: Let's say you have a GNU autotools project in C, which we'll 
call "Xxx", and a set of Python bindings, PyXxx.  Combinator deals with 
this by using ~/.local, and providing scripts to set up PATH and 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to ~/.local/bin and ~/.local/lib, respectively. 
I'm not suggesting that Python come with such a tool (although it might 
be handy, at least until this convention catches on with distributors), 
but it should at least make it clear how one would achieve the following 
straightforwardly:

  cd xxx-0.2.4
  ./configure --prefix ~/.local
  make
  make install
  cd ../pyxxx-0.0.1
  python setup.py install --prefix ~/.local

Using Combinator, the user is now fully set up to "import xxx".  But 
only if they're using Linux, because I made the same mistake (which we 
will probably be correcting at some point soon) of using Python's 
*existing* per-user site-packages directory of ~/Library/Python on the 
mac, and not adding ~/.local.

On the Mac, our user now has a problem: given that ~/Library/Python/ 
doesn't follow the /usr or /usr/local style filesystem layout, 
autotools-based projects will not build their libraries in the right 
places using a single command-line option.  (I guess maybe you could do 
something with --bindir and --sbindir and --exec-prefix or whatever, I 
don't know.  I tend to get bored and wander off when I have to pass more 
than 3 options to a configure script.)

A user familiar with the Mac alone might know what to do at this point 
(to be honest, I don't!), but I do know that people familiar with both 
platforms are confused by this apparently gratuitous inconsistency. 
They follow familiar procedure on a Linux box, it works great, then they 
do the same thing on a Mac (with the same shell, an apparently similar 
version of Python) and it doesn't.  Keep in mind that "./configure 
--prefix" is familiar procedure from a lot more places than Combinator. 
For example, on shared hosting where I didn't have root, I've used this 
same trick without Combinator, building Python itself with --prefix 
~/.local and editing .bashrc to modify the appropriate env vars.

My suggestion would be to have *both* ~/.local *and* ~/Library/Python be 
honored on the Mac, because there really isn't much harm in doing so. 
Perhaps it would make sense for non-framework builds to not honor 
~/Library/Python, but I am pretty certain, based on experience fielding 
requests from confused users, that framework builds should still honor 
~/.local/lib/python.../site-packages.

Windows has this problem less because everything has to be done so 
completely differently.

In any event, the really important thing from my perspective is that the 
PEP should explain how this very common use-case for per-user 
installation of libraries can be accomplished on each of the "big three" 
platforms.  This explanation should be put somewhere that users can 
easily find it when they are building libraries.

I don't know what the "right way" to do this on Windows is though, so I 
can't offer much help there.  Something to do with MinGW and intense 
suffering, I would guess.
>* The patch also adds a usecustomize hook to site. Is it useful and
>  should it stay?

Should this be "usercustomize"?  I thought it was a typo but I see the 
same typo in the PEP.  I have often wished for something like this for 
debugging, and it might have other uses, but there should be a caution 
against abuse :).

The Mac directories look fine to me.

Is it worthwhile to note in the PEP that the directories for the Mac  
are already used in Python 2.5?

Yes, because that makes supporting users easier and keeps things nice  
and simple (no need to ask which kind of Python they installed to  
determine where their user directory is).  Distutils should already  
link extensions in a way that allows you to have a python2.6 unix- 
build and framework-build that share the same site-packages directory.

Have you read glyph's posting? He brought up some good points why Python
on Mac should use ~/.local.

Framework builds have an additional import directory in ~/Library/Python

Regarding Windows, I personally think its OK (but I also personally think
the status-quo is OK too).  As has already been mentioned in this thread,
Windows actually provides an API you can call to determine various "well
known" folders.  I assume the PEP literally means "the environment variable
APPDATA" instead of the result of SHGetSpecialFolderPath(CSIDL_APPDATA); it
might be worth mentioning that (and ideally *why* the env-var is preferred).
Similarly, a justification for why CSIDL_APPDATA/%APPDATA% is preferred over
CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA - ie, why we are suggesting Python is a "roaming"
application (eg, this implies that in certain Unix environments, it is
likely that ~/.local/ will follow users as they log into different machines
on the network - I've no idea how true that is) 

> * Should the Windows installer add %APPDATA%/Python/Scripts to PATH?

I'd recommend not; IIUC, Python's main binary directory isn't added to the
path, but even if it was, it will only be useful if .py is also on PATHEXT.
Either way though, I'd suggest that particular decision is outside the scope
of the PEP and a question for the windows installer assuming the PEP be
accepted.  Maybe some general hand-waving along the lines of "env vars on
Windows are left to the installer, where such global issues are considered
in a wider context" would do :)

Cheers,

Mark

Isn't SHGetSpecialFolderPath() XP and newer only? Python 2.6 is going to
support 2000 and newer. I've written a patch for the ntpath module which
adds a getshellfolders() function. The function uses SHGetFolderPathW to
build a dict of id to path mappings. The patch is available at
http://bugs.python.org/issue1763. Maybe you have some time to review it?

As far as I understand and remember the Windows API SHGetFolderPath()
and friends are retrieving the information from the registry. The shell
folder keys are (IIRC) REG_EXPAND_SZ keys which are expanded with the
function ExpandEnvironmentStrings(). So at the end CSIDL_APPDATA uses
the %APPDATA% env var -- unless I'm totally mistaken.

Or do you suggest that I'm using the win32 API calls instead of the env var?

Point taken! I'll justify why I view Python as a roaming app. All
company and university Linux boxes I've used in the past had exported
$HOME via NFS. So ~/.local is roamed.

*hehe* I love your idea.
It should be trivial to write a view lines of Python code which modify
PATH in HKCU. I'm going to write a simple example and drop it into
Tools/scripts/.

I think there is a slight subtlety here: the exported NFS
$HOME is more equivalent to the HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH which
comes from the HOME directory in NT/AD. ie it is simply
a share pointed to by a drive letter available wherever
the user logs on. Roaming profiles actually *copy* the
data from your network versions of USERPROFILE to the
local machine [need to check they still do this; a while
since I've administered this kind of setup].

The difference therefore is that installing large quantities
of Python modules into a roaming profile path will involve
their being copied to-and-fro on logon/logoff which, historically
at least, was a known cause of slow startup/shutdown. I'll
try to confirm if this is still the case.

My own feeling was to use ~/.local on Windows as well
(or whatever is agreed on for *nix) and let os.path.expanduser
handle it. But... from r54364, USERPROFILE takes priority
over HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH. Obviously Georg had some rationale
there although a quick search of python-dev doesn't throw
anything up. If we decide anything else here, though, we
would seem to be somewhat in conflict with that interpretation
of home/~ as USERPROFILE.

I'm not sure exactly how that is implemented, and I'm not necessarily
arguing you must call that function (eg, it's not hard to argue the env-var
may be preferred, as it offers an easy override) - it's just that the PEP
shouldn't be silent about the issue.

Something I meant to mention was that supporting multiple "per-user"
directories could be considered - that way CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA could be
added later.  YAGNI is easy to justify here, but now is the time to consider
such issues.

I'm afaid I haven't.  The base-addresses are fairly easily tested - just
import each and every module listed while running under the debugger - if
you see messages in the output window telling you about relocation, you have
a problem :)  pywin32 is screaming for a new release (it didn't manage a
single one in 2007!) and that is likely to happen before I get to play with
the new-fangled stuff <wink>

If it should, I think the PEP should explain the attack this defends
against in more detail.  The current brief mention of "security issues"
is a bit hand-wavey.  For example, what is the relationship between
security, this feature, and the PYTHONPATH environment variable?  Isn't
the attack of putting malicious code into a user site-packages directory
the same as the attack of putting it into a directory in PYTHONPATH?

The PYTHONPATH env var has the same security implications. However a
user has multiple ways to avoid problems. For example the user can use
the -E flag or set up sudo to ignore the environment.

The uid and gid tests aren't really required. They just provide an extra
safety net if a user forgets to add the -s flag to a suid app.

I can't comment on the matter. I've not used roaming user profiles on
Windows for more than five years. Can someone with more experience shed

The PEP already explains why I don't want to write to ~/ on Windows. I
had considered it shortly but MSDN advices against it.

Is %USERPROFILE% not equal to %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%? Maybe Gregor did a
mistake because he thought that both point to the same location.

IMHO the question is wrong. MacOS X is a UNIX platform (and Apple has  
the paperwork to prove it), but at the same time it has a non- 
traditional filesystem layout.

The "darwin" system at the foundation of OSX is a classic unix system,  
with the usual filesystem layout, but the bits that make OSX OSX use a  
completely diffent filesystem layout.

The framework build of Python definitly targets the upper layer of the  
OSX stack, not just the Unix core. This sometimes causes confusion,  
but mostly from developers wandering over from a Linux system that  
complain that OSX isn't Linux.

Note that even Darwin is not Linux, there are several differences that  
cause problems for naive porters. Two of those: Darwin uses different  
binary formats for shared libraries and plugins;  the darwin linker  
hardcodes the full path to shared libraries into executables (without  
a runtime search path).

And that's only the start of fun, universal (fat) binaries make live  
even more interesting.

~/Library/Combinator would be a better installation root on OSX, that  
location fits better into guidelines from Apple and also avoids  
completely hiding the Combinator data from the user.

This is probably off-topic for python-dev, but how is combinator  
different from zc.buildout and virtualenv?

I'm particularly liking virtualenv at the moment as it allows me to  
have seperate trees for projects without having several full python  
installations.

Why? Just because users can't remember on which platform they are  
developing ;-)? That said, there's a libpython.a file in the framework  
build for basicly that reason: enough users complained about there not  
being a python library they could link to that it was easier to add a  
symlink then trying to educate everyone.

You could teach Combinator about running configure scripts ;-).

This is not a gratuitous inconsistency.  The Mac developers (mostly  
Jack Jansen, but I was involved as well) decided that following the

As long as the default installation location is still ~/Library/Python/

I don't know if the PEP should mention this, but I do agree that this  
should be in the Python documentation.

Roaming profiles still load and save the profile on logon/logoff. I 
think using the home directory (or subdirectory thereof) is preferable 
as that can *either* be on a shared drive *or* part of the roaming profile.

I'm not sure how sudo gets involved.  sudo doesn't set the euid, it sets
the uid.  This is about programs with the setuid bit set.  (I assume this
doesn't also apply to Python programs that explicitly make use of the
seteuid() call, since this will probably only be checked at interpreter
startup before any Python application code has run.)

It's not much of a safety net if PYTHONPATH still allows injection of
arbitrary code.  It's just needless additional complexity for no benefit.

On the other hand, if all of the other mechanisms for modifying how
imports work is also made to behave this way, then maybe there's a point.

Entirely understood, but then...

No. On my machine, for example:

HOMEDRIVE=H:
HOMEPATH=\
HOMESHARE=\\vogbs022\it\goldent

USERPROFILE=C:\Documents and Settings\goldent

However, using an account without a mapped home
drive then yes, they are the same.

MacOS isn't the only platform that has this problem.  I use cygwin under 
Windows, and I wish Python (whether or not a cygwin build) would also 
use ~/.local.

I guess Windows isn't as bad as MacOS in this case, because there's no 
standard to follow and conflict with.  Everything under whatever 
directory we choose won't likely match other packages, so we can do 
whatever we want.  Still, I'd prefer something under $HOME.

True, except that cygwin tries hard to make it look like Unix.  I'd 
rather Python under Windows really look like Unix, but I'm probably in a 
minority.  And yes, I do share computers (physically and through 
Terminal Server), so per-user local libraries would be nice.

Eric.

The framework build targets both layers, as I understand it - and it 
sounds like you're saying it too, since it's not "just" the UNIX core. 
Solaris isn't Linux either, by the way.  These conventions hold across 
far more than one operating system :).

Distutils should take care of this distinction in Python's case, no? 
Xxx's autotools generate a shared library, PyXxx's setup.py generates a 
plugin (or "dylib", is that still what they're called these days?).

I disagree, but Combinator's a complex beast and has a lot of other 
moving parts which need to live in specific places.  Its main purpose is 
to manage your import path to easily switch between different 
development branches of multiple projects, and so most of its data is 
already in locations that the user has specified.

A key thing about ~/.local in this case is that it isn't specific to 
Combinator.  It's any per-user installed dependency libraries for 
development purposes, not necessarily on Combinator-managed projects, 
and not even necessarily Python projects.
>This is probably off-topic for python-dev, but how is combinator 
>different from zc.buildout and virtualenv?

We are definitely veering in that direction, but it probably bears a 
brief description just so folks here can see how it does and doesn't 
apply to the PEP.  zc.buildout and virtualenv are primarily 
heterogeneous deployment tools, with development being just a different 
type of deployment.  They're ways of installing Python packages into an 
isolated, configured environment.

Combinator is primarily a development tool.  Although I've used it as a 
deployment tool (as you can use zc.buildout as a development tool) 
that's not really its focus.  Combinator has no "installation" step for 
most projects.  ~/.local is a special case, reserved for common 
unchanging dependencies that require building; most code managed by 
Combinator lives in ~/Projects/YourProject/trunk or 
~/Projects/YourProject/branches.  (I *used* to be a Mac guy.  Can you 
tell? :-))

The idea with zc.buildout is you are installing application A which 
requires library X version Q, and installing application B which 
requires library X version M; you want to keep those separated.  The 
idea with combinator is that you are *developing* application A, and you 
want to make sure that it continues working with both version Q and M, 
so you can easily do

    chbranch X releases/Q  # the most common combinator command
    trial a.test
    chbranch X releases/M
    trial a.test

It also has specific integration with subversion for creating and 
merging branches.  chbranch will try to check out releases/Q if there 
isn't already such a directory present, based on svn metadata.  When you 
create a branch to start working on a feature, your environment is 
automatically reconfigured to import code from that branch.  When you 
merge a branch to trunk, it is adjusted to load code from the merged 
trunk again.  Hopefully some day soon it will also have integration with 
bazaar too.

The system installation of Python on the mac has a nod in this direction 
as well.  /usr/bin/python is also present, as is /usr/lib/pythonX.Y?0Cas 
symlinks between the two locations.
>You could teach Combinator about running configure scripts ;-).

Better yet, perhaps somebody should teach configure about MacOS, and 
about per-user installation ;).  But the real question here is not what 
Combinator should do, but what Python should do.

I agree.  I'm not saying Python shouldn't follow the platform 
conventions of NeXTSTEP^WOpenStep^WYellowBox^WCocoa - is it still called 
Cococa? - but to follow both those conventions and the conventions of 
its other pedigree, at least until autotools knows how to properly 
populate ~/Library/Frameworks.
>As long as the default installation location is still ~/Library/Python/ 
>X.Y for framework builds I wouldn't mind too much.

Is there a default "installation" location?  When we started this part 
of the discussion, it was just which paths should be on sys.path.

I agree, though.  I would like to propose that if the user does not have 
write access to the system installation location, distutils should 
select ~/.local or ~/Library (or %APPDATA%) as appropriate by default. 
The only problem with this proposal is that distutils' --prefix ~/.local 
will pick up on the autotools-friendly ~/.local/include and ~/.local/lib 
for building C extensions, whereas it's not clear where to look for 
where autotools might have put those things in ~/Library.  That is 
arguably a separate issue though, and I think we should close one can of 
worms before opening another, if possible.

The PEP interacts with it, so it should make reference to it, but the 
explanation needs to go somewhere users will see it.

I would like to agree.  MacOS has an advantage here though.  Windows, 
even without cygwin, but doubly so once cygwin gets involved, has a 
schizophrenic idea of what "~" means.  (I believe other messages in this 
thread have made reference to issues with expanduser.)  You definitely 
are going to have a hard time getting non-cygwin and cygwin python to 
agree on the location of your home directory.  I rather brutally 
modified my last Windows installation to get those two values to line 
up, and it required surgery for each user created, and caused a number 
of "interesting issues" with various tools writing fake cygwin UNIX 
paths and others thinking they were Windows drive-letter paths...

If you can figure out how to make this work without raising any of the 
bogeymen I just made reference to, I would be strongly in favor.

By confusing users' expectations, it may actually be *worse* to add this 
"safety net" than to do nothing.  It should be obvious right now that 
tightly controlling the environment is a requirement of any suid Python 
code.  However, talking about different behavior in the case of 
differing euid and uid might confuse some developers and/or 
administrators into thinking that Python was doing all it needed to. 
There's also the confusion that the value of $HOME is actually the 
relevant thing for controlling "user-installed" imports, not the (E)UID.

I think it would be good to have a look at the security implications of 
this and other environment-dependent execution, including $PYTHONPATH 
and $PYTHONSTARTUP, in a separate PEP.  It might be good to change the 
way some of these things work, but in either case it would be good to 
have an unambiguous declaration of the *expected* security properties 
and potential attack vectors against the Python interpreter, for both 
developers and system administrators.

Given this information (and the earlier comments about roaming
profiles) I would suggest that Python should use %HOMEDRIVE%HOMEPATH%.
This matches os.path.expanduser('~'). My previous comments were based
on my experience on a machine without a mapped home drive, so I'd
missed the distinction.

Yes, this does contradict the Microsoft guideline that you shouldn't
write to USERPROFILE, but Microsoft themselves set HOMEDRIVE and
HOMEPATH, so they vioated the guidelines, not us :-).

The point here is that we want "the user's home". This is clearly
%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% on Windows, guidelines notwithstanding.

I'm pretty sure I've seen a suggestion for a distutils options for  
installing into your home location (something like "python setup.py  
install --user").

A few datapoints here from WinXP SP2. I'll try Win2k when I
get home this evening if no-one's done it before then.

--------------

My support guys have temporarily switched me over to a roaming
profile so I could check what happens. As
expected, all the non-Local... folders are copied to and from
the network share specified as ProfilePath on my AD entry. (In
fact, our policy forbids profiles bigger than a few tens of Mb
so I had to hive off my existing profile and create a new one
to do this test).

Ignoring Terminal Services -- which have their own profiles --
and Cygwin -- which does its own thing -- we have four
situations: Users with and without mapped HOME drives; and with
and without network (roaming) profiles.

USERPROFILE points to c:\docu..\goldent regardless of whether
it's a network-based profile or not. The difference is what
happens when you log on/off.

If the home drive is mapped, HOMEDRIVE/PATH point to that mapping
If the home drive isn't mapped, HOMEDRIVE/PATH point to
USERPROFILE.

APPDATA is a non-local part of othe profile and as such is
copied to and from the network share if the profile is roaming.

--------------

There doesn't seem to be a clear solution.

If we point to APPDATA, HOMEDRIVE/PATH or USERPROFILE
we might be bulking up the content a user has to copy
to and fro. And local space policies might hinder things.

If we point to local settings\application data then the
packages won't roam with the user.

The best we can hope for is to point to HOMEDRIVE/PATH as
Paul suggested (*possibly* rewiring os.path.expanduser to
try that first, depending on Win2K stuff) and make sure
the user is aware of what might happen if the HOMEDRIVE/PATH
is really a pointer to a network-based profile.

I know, but somehow most people I run into that even know that there

Distutils does take care of it, but that doesn't stop users from  
complaining that 'cc -shared' doesn't result in a workable python  
extension ;-).

BTW. dylibs are shared libraries, there is no common suffix for  
bundles. Python uses '.so' for its bundle, adding to the confusion for  
folks used to systems using ELF libraries ;-)

Ah, so ~/.local is "just" a per-user variation on /usr/local? I didn't  
even know of that convention before this thread started, I tend to use  
~/local (without dot) instead.

os.path.expanduser uses HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH. It checks for an explicit
HOME (set manually by the user, this isn't a Windows standard name)
first. (At least in 2.5, see ntpath.py)

I think consistency with os.path.expanduser('~') is a significant benefit.

Given that os.path.expanduser allows HOME to override
HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH, users in this position could set an explicit HOME.

The one downside of following expanduser is that Christian's code is
in C, where ntpath.expanduser is in Python, so there are 2 versions to
keep in sync. Maybe Christian could expose his C implementation, which
ntpath.expanduser could then reuse?

Ummm... see my earlier point a few posts back which refers
to r54364 which gave priority to USERPROFILE over HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH

Agreed entirely.

> Given that os.path.expanduser allows HOME to override

You're right of course (and that's what I do now, in fact). It's
just that it doesn't feel quite right relying on a nonstandard
env var. It means if I log on to another machine and want to
take advantage of these theoretically roaming Python modules
I'd have to remember to set my HOME var to something.

If it had its priorities switched around, Christian's patch could simply
call os.path.expanduser.

I'll hold off now. The situation's clear enough and I'm not really
offering anything here. There hard part's going to be making a
decision. I think my proposal amounts to:

1) Switch the priority of env var checks in os.path.expanduser
so that HOMEDRIVE/PATH comes before USERPROFILE.
2) Have the new code use os.path.expanduser under Windows
3) Document the fact that installing in a per-user way might
be writing considerable amounts to a network-based profile.

Sorry. I'd not realised this was a post-2.5 revision (ie, not in
released code yet...)

Looking at the change, it appears that the point is to support ~user,
which it does by getting the current user's home, and replacing the
last part, on the assumption that it is the user name.

This works for USERPROFILE (in my experience, I don't know if there
are corner cases where it isn't true) but does *not* work if HOME is
set, and only works otherwise by preferring USERPROFILE over
HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH (and I believe that preference is misleading, as
USERPROFILE is always set if HOMEDRIVE/PATH is, so there's no point
checking for HD/HP if USERDIR fails).

I'd recommend that this change be reverted. To correctly get another
user's home directory would involve reading (via the registry, or
maybe some utility function I couldn't find at a quick glance) the
value of HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH which is set for the other user. (In fact,
given that I guess these could be set in a login script, it's entirely
possible that the information simply isn't available).

I don't believe that ~user is a useful concept on Windows, and I'd
rather that code using it fail than give what are quite probably
unreliable answers.

If someone wants to support ~user where user is the name of the
current user, then that could be covered by an explicit check that the
name matches, and if so use the code for '~', but personally I don't
think that's worth it.

If you have read the PEP then I'm pretty sure that you have read about

I concur! The changes should be reverted. The implementation is most
likely to fail in more elaborate cases, e.g. c:\users\a\alpha or
c:\users\groupa\name. The proper way for a ~user implementation is a
bunch of Win32 API calls.

What code are you talking about? Except for the -s option PEP 370 is
implemented in Python. Or are you talking about my
os.path.getshellfolder() patch?

No, I can't use expanduser("~") because there is no sensible way to get
from the path to APPDATA. In it's infinite wisdom MS has decided to
localize the name of its shell folders. On my German WinXP box the
APPDATA folder is called "Anwendungsdaten".

3) is sensible but I'd prefer 4):

4) Default to the %APPDATA% env var but give the user a chance to
overwrite the policy with the env var PYTHONUSERBASE, or whatever is a
good name for it. Did I mention that I'm not good in naming things? *g*

Frustratingly, I don't believe there's *any* canonical
way to find ~user without actually going through the whole
process of getting a token and impersonating them. If
they've logged onto this machine already you can have
a good go by following the code posted the other day
on c.l.py [1] (although I'm now not sure about the l10n
aspects which Christian mentioned). Any technique of
going up one (from your own profile) and then down one
is no better than assuming that all users are in /home
on a *nix box.

As to a logged-on user's *own* home path, I'd prefer
HOMEDRIVE/PATH over USERPROFILE since the latter is at
least explictly named HOMEsomething, although the latter
can be the fallback. Both are present on Win2k & on WinXP.
Can't check WinNT or Win9x but I don't know if we're looking
to support those or not.

A while ago I've seen a variant of ExpandEnvironmentStrings that takes a
user token, too. It's called ExpandEnvironmentStringsForUser().
http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa373507(VS.85).aspx

Before anybody gets exciting about the good news: Here is the bad news.
A user token can't be obtained easily. In fact it requires a login +
password or a process handler. :(

Python 2.6 targets Windows 2000 and newer. So no, we don't have to
support NT and the 9x series any more.

I'm taking your suggestion under consideration: ~/.local for standard

Good point, but is it the job of the PEP to explain such problems in
detail? The PEP should consider the problem but the explanation belongs
to a tutorial - IMHO.

Yeah! I've a tendency to drag typos through my code because I heavily
use copy 'n paste. A while ago I copied a typo from C code into the
Python unit tests and later into the docs, too

I assume ~/.local was first introduced by the freedesktop.org people. On
my box it's only used for some desktop related apps like
~/.local/share/Trash or XFC4.

http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/basedir-spec

Contrary to ~/local, the dot local directory doesn't show up, unless the
user unhides dot files.

I've only seen ~/.local/ defined there, and only ~/.local/share/ in  
that case.  Anything beyond that is grass-roots, and still pretty  
obscure.

That said, I think extending usage of ~/.local/ is fine for things  
that aren't supposed to be edited or directly used by users.  ~/.local/ 
bin/ seems suspect.

To add another twist to this the HOMEDRIVE mapping is not guarantied at all on
windows startup (http://www.google.com/search?q=windows+homedrive+mapping). This
has caused a lot of pain for me in the past.

Can this be changed into using %APPDATA% by default and changing to
%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% based on some MSI switch?

I believe the issue of whether and how to backport bytes (and
bytearray?) from 3.0 to 2.6 has come up before, but I don't think
we've come to any kind of conclusion. It's quite subtle. In a private
email, Thomas Wouters and I discussed this:

My recommendation is to leave it out of 2.6.

Not every 3.0 concept has to be backported.  This particular one doesn't have a straight-forward integration.  It duplicates some existing functionality and in general doesn't make life better for the 2.6 coder.  The only benefit I can see is that it lets you write code that is a step closer to 3.0; however, it has not been our goal to write one piece of code that runs under both major releases.

I think both 2.x and 3.0 are better served if 2.x cleanly stays with the str/uncode model and 3.0 sticks with the bytes/text model.  Commingling the two muddies the waters and conflates the distinctions.  I think it best to make that jump all at once.

Multiple-ways-to-do-it should not be the motto for 2.6.  Instead, let's provide the best transition tools possible and keep both 2.6 and 3.0 as clean as possible (no duplicative or half-intergrated functionality).

Indeed. However, it *is* one of our stated goals that 2.6 will provide
a variety of features that will make source-to-source conversion more
likely to succeed. I'm currently expecting that the str/unicode/bytes
issue is by far the biggest issue where automated conversion is
unlikely to be effective. *If* we provide some kind of "backport" of
bytes (even if it's just an alias for or trivial subclass of str), it
should be part of a strategy that makes it easier to write code that
runs under 2.6 and can be automatically translated to run under 3.0
with the same semantics.

I realize that this is a lofty goal and that I haven't thought through
how to get there -- maybe it won't be possible anyway, but I think
it's worth a try. (I'll think about it more later.)

Well, 2.6 *is* one of the transition tools. We should probably do a
case study on the back of an envelope on how to take existing code
that deals with encoded text, decoded text, and binary data, and how
to restructure it for automatic translation to correct 3.0 code.

If it's just an alias or trivial subclass, then we 
haven't added anything that can't be done trivially
by the 2-to-3 tool.

I'm thinking that this is a deeper change. 
It doesn't serve either 2.6 or 3.0 to conflate
str/unicode model with the bytes/text model.
Mixing the two in one place just creates a mess
in that one place.

I'm sure we're thinking that this is just an optional
transition tool, but the reality is that once people
write 2.6 tools that use the new model,
then 2.6 users are forced to deal with that model.
It stops being optional or something in the future,
it becomes a mental jump that needs to be made now
(while still retaining the previous model in mind
for all the rest of the code).

I don't think you need a case study to forsee that
it will be unpleasant to work with a code base
that commingles the two world views.

One other thought.  I'm guessing that apps that would
care about the distinction are already using unicode
and are already treating text as distinct from arrays
of bytes.  Instead, it's backwards thinking 20th-century
neanderthal ascii-bound folks like myself who are going
to have transition issues.  It would be nice for us
knuckle-draggers to not have to face the issue until 3.0.

I found this posting, and those following it, as I too am baffled that
NamedTemporaryFile doesn't let you read the generated file - even within the
same script.
For unit testing it is very commonplace to generate a test file on the fly
and then use it as input the function being tested. NamedTemporaryFile would
be the perfect candidate for this except that the file seems to disappear
immediately after it has been closed. This is contrary to Dustin's comment
which states that the lifetime extends until the object is garbage collected.
The following script illustrates this isn't the case: 

from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile
fid = NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w',
                         suffix='.tmp',
                         dir='.')
        
fid.write('My temp file')
fid.close()

# Read it (fid hasn't been garbage collected yet)
print fid.name

# But the file itself has gone
fid2 = open(fid.name)
print fid2.readlines()


Can someone please help point me to the best way of creating temporary files
in Python that can be read in immediately after their creation.

Thanks

For both TemporaryFile and NamedTemporaryFile, the rationale is that
"temporary" extends until the object is garbage collected.
TemporaryFile is deleted immediately (to prevent other applications from
modifying your temporary file).  NamedTemporaryFile is inteded for use
when you need access to the file by filename during the lifetime of the
file.  In either case, when the object goes, the file should too.

I suggest you study how the 2to3 tool actually works before asserting this.

Consider the following function.

def stuff(blah):
  foo = ""
  while True:
    bar = blah.read(1024)
    if bar == "":
      break
    foo += bar
  return foo

Is it reading text or binary data from stream blah? We can't tell.  If
it's meant to be reading text, 2to3 should leave it alone. But if it's
meant to be reading binary data, 2to3 should change the string
literals to bytes literals (b"" in this case). (If it's used for both,
there's no hope.) As it stands, 2to3 hasn't a chance to decide what to
do, so it will leave it alone -- but the "translated" code will be
wrong if it was meant to be reading bytes.

However, if the two empty string literals were changed to b"", we
would know it was reading bytes. 2to3 could leave it alone, but at
least the untranslated code would be correct for 2.6 and the
translated code would be correct for 3.0.

This may seem trivial (because we do all the work, and 2to3 just
leaves stuff alone), but having b"" and bytes as aliases for "" and
str in 2.6 would mean that we could write 2.6 code that correctly
expresses the use of binary data -- and we could use u"" and unicode
for code using text, and 2to3 would translate those to "" and str and
the code would be correct 3.0 text processing code.

Note that we really can't make 2to3 assume that all uses of str and ""
are referring to binary data -- that would mistranslate the vast
majority of code that does non-Unicode-aware text processing, which I
estimate is the majority of small and mid-size programs.

This may be true. But still, 2.6 *will* run 2.5 code without any
effort, so we will be able to mix modules using the 2.5 style and
modules using the 3.0 style (or at least some aspects of 3.0 style) in
one interpreter. Neither 2.5 nor 3.0 will support this combination.
That's why 2.6 is so important it's a stepping stone.

Well, you shouldn't commingle the two world view in a single module or
package. But that would just be bad style -- you shouldn't use
competing style rules within a package either (like using
words_with_underscores and camelCaseWords for method names).

Yes, but 99% of these still accept str instances in positions where
they require text. The problem is that the str type and its literals
are ambiguous -- their use is not enough to be able to guess whether
text or data is meant. Just being able to (voluntarily! on a
per-module basis!) use a different type name and literal style for
data could help forward-looking programmers get started on making the
distinction clear, thus getting ready for 3.0 without making the jump
just yet (or maintaining a 2.6 and a 3.0 version of the same package
easily, using 2to3 to automatically generate the 3.0 version from the
2.6 code base).

Oh, you won't. Just don't use the -3 command-line flag and don't put
"from __future__ import <whatever>" at the top of your modules, and
you won't have to change your ways at all. You can continue to
distribute your packages in 2.5 syntax that will also work with 2.6,
and your users will be happy (as long as they don't want to use your
code on 3.0 -- but if you want to give them that, *that* is when you
will finally be forced to face the issue. :-)

Note that I believe that the -3 flag should not change semantics -- it
should only add warnings. Semantic changes must either be backwards
compatible or be requested explicitly with a __forward__ import (which
2to3 can remove).

Indeed.  Mailman, for instance.  Yet Mailman still has problems with
(broken) wire protocol that sneaks past the gate, and causes some
exception that is only handled by the top-level "no matter what goes
wrong, we're not going to lose this post" handler (which literally
shunts it into a queue that only human admins look it -- it's not
Mailman's problem any more.)

However, I am not sure it would help Mailman to catch such bugs to
move from the str/unicode paradigm to the bytes/text paradigm.  The
problem Mailman faces is that there is no (single) Japanese foyer
where the characters have to exchange their muddy "bytes" shoes for
nice clean "unicode" slippers.  Instead, there are a number of ways to
get in, and the translation takes place (and sometimes not) at
different stages.  But this is not a Python issue; it has to do with
Mailman's design.

So I don't think this would be improved if we changed the paradigm
forcibly.  I don't see a benefit to apps like Mailman from changing
over in 2.x.

Thank you very much for the quick reply.

I believe we have to close the file in order be able to read it in - in this
case to feed a unittest. I actually tried to read it in before closing it,
but (as I suspected) the data wasn't available.
 
We use unit testing for pretty much all functions and classes in our system.
Some functions read files and do something with them. We therefore need a
standardised and robust way to generate temporary files that exist on the
filesystem long enough for the function being tested to read them.

We are happy to write a wrapper ourselves that will do just that - but before
doing so we had a look at the standard functionality. Hence the question
about NamedTemporaryFile: What is the purpose of creating a name if it
disappears after the file object is closed? I agree with Dustin that it would
make sense for the file to live on the disk for as long as the File object is
available to the script, closed or not. But I don't think that is the way
NamedTemporaryFile currently works as illustrated in the test script in my
first posting.

Any help or comments, please?

Cheers
Ole Nielsen, Geoscience Australia

Were you planning to make bytes a __future__ (or __forward__?) import?
I think making it so should satisfy Raymond's concerns.  Even if whatever
you eventually do is technically backwards compatible, he is suggesting 
that
conceptually, it is not.  I see some validity to that view.

I see. There's a healthy benefit for 2to3 translation that cannot be
accomplished in any other way.   This may potentially more than offset the
negative impact to the 2.x world where it complexifies the language
without any immediate payoff.

FWIW, I'm sold on the rationale.  Hopefully, this can be confined
to just annotation and aliasing but not porting back any C API
changes or code that depends on the bytes/text distinction. I worry
that as soon as the annotation is made available, it will ripple
throughout the code and pervade the language so that it cannot
be ignored by Py2.6 coders.  It's a bit of a Pandora's Box.

Are we going to be "forward-looking" and change all of the
standard library modules?  Is this going to pop-up everywhere
and become something you have to know about whether or
not you're a volunteering forward-looking programmer?  I hope not.

Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  A thousand times yes!  :-D

This is *the* crucial feature which will make porting large libraries 
like Twisted to 3.0 even possible.  Thank you, Guido.

To the critics of this idea: libraries which process text, if they are 
meant to be correct, will need to deal explicitly with the issue of what 
data-types they believe to be text, what methods they will call on them, 
and how they deal with them.  You cannot get away from this.  It is not 
an issue reserved for the "pure" future of 3.0; if your code doesn't 
handle these types correctly now, it has bugs in it *now*.  (In fact I 
am fixing some code with just such a bug in it right now :).)

It is definitely possible to make your library code do the right thing 
for different data types, continue to support str literals in 2.6, and 
eventually require text / unicode input (after an appropriate 
deprecation period, of course).  And it will be a lot easier if the 
translations imposed by 2to3 are as minimal as possible.

Well you can hardly believe this requirement is so novel that its

The mistake you made was to change the mode from the default "w+b". The 
following code works on both Windows and Linux:

from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile
fid = NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w+b',
                          suffix='.tmp',
                          dir='.')

fid.write('My temp file')
fid.seek(0)
data = fid.read()
print data
fid.close()


By the way, this is the sort of topic normally reserved for 
comp.lang.python, whose denizens would have straightened you out in no 
time flat.

What a pity.  Can the order be changed in which the extensions are built,
or should the importing be tried after all the extensions are ready?
Or should _weakref be made a builtin module?

Is the bytes type required for PEP3118 'Revising the buffer protocol'?
I just started to work on implementing this PEP for ctypes, in the
hope that these changes can be merged into trunk.

Hi Travis,

The pep contains this sample:

"""

        struct {
             int ival;
             double data[16*4];

"""

I think it is wrong and must be changed to the following; is this correct?

"""

        struct {

from __future__ import bytes ? What should the __future__ statement change?

* "" returns unicode instead of str
* b"" is allowed and returns bytes (a new subclass of str)
* u"" is still allowed and returns unicode, too.
* The str built-in is not available.

Agreed! Should the -3 flag also warn about deprecated features which can
easily migrated with 2to3? In the past a warning for `` (back ticks)
were added. The feature is deprecated but the migration is very simple.

A 2to26 fixer may be worth implementing, too. It could migrate minor
changes like `` -> repr and "except egg, spam" -> "except egg as spam".

I'll stick to APPDATA but I'm going to introduce a new env var
PYTHONUSERBASE. It overwrites the path to the base directory and allows
users (and companies) to adjust the user directory for all Python versions.

While it *could* be made conditional on a __future__ import, the cost
of those (both in terms of implementing them and using them) is rather
high so I'd prefer it to be always available. Given Raymond's later
response, I'm not sure it's worth the effort.

I'm fine with only making this a superficial veneer: b"" and bytes as
aliases for "" and str. However Thomas Heller's response requires more
thought.

Well, that's one opinion against another. And I presume by now you
have read Glyph's enthusiastic response. Getting Twisted on 3.0 is a
big enabler for getting other 3rd party packages an apps on board!

I have no desire to fix up the standard library cosmetically, and I
don't see the need -- the standard library has already been forward
ported to 3.0, so the rationale just doesn't apply.

I don't think so. I would like to see this PEP backported (but keep
the old 'buffer' of course for b/w compatibility). Whenever this PEP
talks about bytes we can just use str/PyString in the backport.

Remember that the trunk ought to remain backwards compatible with 2.5
-- 2.6 should not break code that worked under 2.5, since we want as
many users as possible to feel comfortable with upgrading to 2.6.

I don't think any of that is necessary. I would rather have the
following two in the language by default (see my response to Terry and
Raymond):

bytes is an alias for str (not even a subclass)
b"" is an alias for ""

Personally, I think such warnings are misguided. -3 should augment
2to3, not duplicate its work.

2to3 with selected options can do that already. But again, I don't see
the point -- 2.6 code can just use 2.5 syntax and 2to3 will take care
of the migration.

There is only one thing I'd like -3 to warn about regarding except
clauses: if the 'err' variable is used past the end of the except
clause. That is a true semantic change that 2to3 cannot easily fix or
flag. Consider this an example of how 2to3 and -3 should augment each
other.

Ah, you like to keep it simple. The aliases are easily to implement.
Give me twenty minutes to implement it and write some unit tests.

Several warnings have to be removed: ``, callable and maybe more.

If you need to read the data by opening the file again (from unittest
code for example), then you need to call fid.flush() (no need for seeking).

Again, comp.lang.python, but I could not resist.

Hi,

Apologies if it's not appropriate to send this email to the mailing
list, however I am really really eager to contribute to the Python
project (as a developer), and wondered whether anyone could advise me
as to some entry-level tasks I could start out with.

Thanks,

Python accepts 0x as an integer literal. Is this intended (the docs
say otherwise, but int() and tokenize.py concur)?

Definitely a bug. I see no use case for this.

In Objective-C it's perfectly common to extend existing classes using  
'categories' and I have often found this idiom very useful.  What is  
described here is basically categories for Python.  I've implemented  
something like this before and I would be happy to see this added to  
the standard library and formalised.

I like this solution because of its simplicity.

If they are like Smalltalk categories, then they are semantically
different. For method categories, you group the methods by
"functionality" or "purpose" or "intended audience", as the developer
of a class. It is important that the category has a name, and the
categories are part of the class' documentation.

For monkey-patching classes, the grouping is "by application". The
additional/changed methods are not written by the author of the
class, but by the author of the application using the class. The
name of the group is irrelevant, and the documentation (if any exists)
documents it as an application-specific thing.

In-between are the partial classes of C# and the way C classes
get implemented: it is the implementor of the class who fragments
the class into separate pieces of code, but not for the sake
of the class clients, but for maintainability of the class itself
(so that you can spread a large class over several source files).

They use same implementation strategy; for integrating it into the
standard library, I think the usage scenarios need to be considered
more. I like to see all three scenarios supported; to support categories
properly, you need to also have support in the reflection, in pydoc,
and perhaps also in the online documentation (if standard library
classes get split into categories).

Martin

One advantage of a subclass is that there could be a flag that warns
about combining bytes and unicode data.  For example, b"x" + u"y"
would produce a warning.  As someone who writes internationalized
software, I would happly use both the byte designating syntax and
the warning flag, even if I wasn't planning to move to Python 3.

Yeah, that's what everybody thinks at first -- but the problem is that
most of the time (in 2.6 anyway) the "bytes" object is something read
from a socket, for example, not something created from a b"" literal.
There is no way to know whether that return value means text or data
(plenty of apps legitimately read text straight off a socket in 2.x),
so the socket object can't return a bytes instance, and hence the
warning won't trigger.

Really, the pure aliasing solution is just about optimal in terms of
bang per buck. :-)

Message-ID: <5d44f72f0801191206x1027a49do62376026727fbb@mail.gmail.com>

In the Rational class that I've recently checked into Python 2.6
(http://bugs.python.org/issue1682), it might be nice to provide a
method that, given a particular rational number, returns a nearby
number that's nicer in some way. I know of two reasonable behaviors
for this operation. Since I don't know which is likely to be more
useful, or even if either is useful enough to include in the first
version of the module, I'm coming to you guys for advice. Both were
implemented a while ago in
http://svn.python.org/view/sandbox/trunk/rational/Rational.py?rev=40988&view=markup
and are based on the continued fraction representation of the number
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction#Best_rational_approximations).

The first returns the closest rational whose denominator is less than
a given integer. For discussion, we might call it
.limit_denominator(), although I'm also looking for good names. This
seems useful for computations in which you want to sacrifice some
accuracy for speed. On the other hand, Decimal may fill the niche for
fast-ish computation that surprises people less than float.

The second returns the simplest rational within some distance. For
instance, it'll prefer 22/7 over 333/106 if both are close enough. We
might call it .simplest_within() for now. This seems useful for
converting from float and displaying results to users, where we prefer
readability over accuracy or have reason to believe that a simpler
fraction might be more correct.

What does the list think?

You can use a mediant walk to get to two surrounding fractions w/ some
limit, and then return the pair to let the caller choose.

See http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/52317
for an imperfect implementation.

Hopefully we'll see those people again.

I'm having trouble imagining a real use case for either of these methods.
 When I'm using Rational, it's almost certainly because I want exact
arithmetic;  if I'm getting results with huge denominators and numerators
then either that's what I really want, or I probably shouldn't have been
using Rational in the first place...

The only semi-use case I see is providing some way for users to turn the
float 1.1 into the rational 11/10, instead
of Rational(2476979795053773L,2251799813685248L).

So I'd say leave both these methods out for now---it would be easy enough to
add them later if it turns out there's a real need.

Just my 200/391 UK pennies :)

IMHO, this is a stretch of the word "legitimately" ;-).  If you're 
reading from a socket, what you're getting are bytes, whether they're 
represented by str() or bytes(); correct code in 2.x must currently do a 
.decode("ascii") or .decode("charmap") to "legitimately" identify the 
result as text of some kind.

Now, ad-hoc code with a fast and loose definition of "text" can still 
read arrays of bytes off a socket without specifying an encoding and get 
away with it, but that's because Python's unicode implementation has 
thus far been very forgiving, not because the data is cleanly text yet. 
Why can't we get that warning in -3 mode just the same from something 
read from a socket and a b"" literal?  I've written lots of code that 
aggressively rejects str() instances as text, as well as unicode 
instances as bytes, and that's in code that still supports 2.3 ;).

Not that I'm particularly opposed to the aliasing solution, either.  It 
would still allow writing code that was perfectly useful in 2.6 as well 
as 3.0, and it would avoid disturbing code that did checks of type(""). 
It would just remove an opportunity to get one potentially helpful 
warning.

I would say that depends on the application, and on arrangements that
client and server may have made off-line about the encoding.

In 2.x, text can legitimately be represented as str -- there's even
the locale module to further specify how it is to be interpreted as
characters.

Sure, this doesn't work for full unicode, and it doesn't work for all
protocols used with sockets, but claiming that only fast and loose
code ever uses str to represent text is quite far from reality -- this
would be saying that the locale module is only for quick and dirty
code, which just ain't so.

> Why can't we get that warning in -3 mode just the same from something

If you really want this, please think through all the consequences,
and report back here. While I have a hunch that it'll end up giving
too many false positives and at the same time too many false
negatives, perhaps I haven't thought it through enough. But if you
really think this'll be important for you, I hope you'll be willing to
do at least some of the thinking.

I believe that a constraint should be that by default (without -3 or a
__future__ import) str and bytes should be the same thing. Or, another
way of looking at this, reads from binary files and reads from sockets
(and other similar things, like ctypes and mmap and the struct module,
for example) should return str instances, not instances of a str
subclass by default -- IMO returning a subclass is bound to break too
much code. (Remember that there is still *lots* of code out there that
uses "type(x) is types.StringType)" rather than "isinstance(x, str)",
and while I'd be happy to warn about that in -3 mode if we could, I
think it's unacceptable to break that in the default environment --
let it break in 3.0 instead.)

Yeah, well, but remember, while keeping you happy is high on my list
of priorities, it's not the only priority. :-)

Right.

I worry that the warning wouldn't come often enough, and that too
often it would be unhelpful. There will inevitably be some stuff where
you just have to try to convert the code using 2to3 and try to run it
under 3.0 in order to see if it works. And there's also the concern of
those who want to use 2.6 because it offers 2.5 compatibility plus a
fair number of new features, but who aren't interested (yet) in moving
up to 3.0. I expect that Google will initially be in this category
too.

Thanks Andrew, and everyone else who participated! I've been doing

While I stand by my statement that unicode is the Right Way to do text 
in python, this particular feature isn't really that important, and I 
can see there are cases where it might cause problems or make life more 
difficult.  I suspect that I won't really know whether I want the 
warning anyway before I've actually tried to port any nuanced, real 
text-processing code to 3.0, and it looks like it's going to be a little 
while before that happens.  I suspect that if I do want the warning, it 
would be a feature for 2.7, not 2.6, so I don't want to waste a lot of 
everyone's time advocating for it.

Now for a nearly irrelevant digression (please feel free to stop reading 
here):

I can see your point.  I think it probably holds better on files and 
streams than on sockets, though - please forgive me if I don't think 
that server applications which require environment-dependent out-of-band 
arrangements about locale are correct :).

I'm aware that this specific example is kind of a ridiculous stretch, 
but it's the first one that came to mind.  Consider 
len(u'?'.encode('utf-8').rjust(5).decode('utf-8')).  Of course 
unicode.rjust() won't do the right thing in the case of surrogate pairs, 
not to mention RTL text, but it still handles a lot more cases than 
str.rjust(), since code points behave a lot more like characters than 
code units do.

It would definitely be overreaching to say all code that uses str is 
quick and dirty.  But I do think that it fits into one of two 
categories: quick and dirty, or legacy.  locale is an example of a 
legacy case for which there is no replacement (that I'm aware of).  Even 
if I were writing a totally unicode-clean application, as far as I'm 
aware, there's no common replacement for i.e. locale.currency().

Still, locale is limiting.  It's ... uncomfortable to call 
locale.currency() in a multi-user server process.  It would be nice if 
there were a replacement that completely separated encoding issues from 
localization issues.

I agree.  But, it's precisely because this is so subtle that it would be 
nice to have tools which would report warnings to help fix it. 
*Certainly* by default, everywhere that's "str" in 2.5 should be "str" 
in 2.6.  Probably even in -3 mode, if the goal there is "warnings only". 
However, the feature still strikes me as potentially useful while 
porting.  If I were going to advocate for it, though, it would be as a 
separate option, e.g. "--separate-bytes-type".  I say this as separate 
from just trying to run the code on 3.0 to see what happens because it 
seems like the most subtle and difficult aspect of the port to get 
right; it would be nice to be able to tweak it individually, without the 
other issues related to 3.0.  For example, some of the code I work on 
has a big stack of dependencies.  Some of those are in C, most of them 
don't process text at all.  However, most of them aren't going to port 
to 3.0 very early, but it would be good to start running in as 3.0-like 
of an environment as possible earlier than that so that the hard stuff 
is done by the time the full stack has been migrated.

Both of these are likely to be of limited use. The most common usage I
know of is to make a "sensible" rational from a float (i.e., a DWIM
style conversion 0.1 -> 1/10) or to provide readable output. On the
other hand, both are subtle to implement, so having a standard
implementation saves people having to code (and debug) their own.

I suspect that simplest within a particular distance is the form that
is most often wanted, but I don't have any good evidence for that
feeling. Putting both in might help people to realise that there *is*
a choice.

Given that you have implemented them, I'd say leave them in. And I
like the names trim and approximate, as given in the code you
referenced.

This makes perfect sense to me.  And yet, I also like the idea that
b""+u"" raises an exception.  I have a suggestion, then: for 2.6, let's
make bytes a subclass of string whose only difference is that it contains
a flag.  I don't care whether b""+u"" raises an exception.  This should
be enough for people on an accelerated 3.0 conversion schedule, and they
can write their own test for the flag if they care.

For 2.7, we can start tightening up.  b""+u"" can raise an exception,
and the socket module might use a RETURN_BYTES variable.

To put it another way, I don't think we should consider 2.6 the stopping
point for 2.x/3.x conversion help.  There's nothing wrong with planning
for features to go into 2.7 -- just as several PEPs in the past have had
multi-version planning.

I enjoyed the bug day a lot and will certainly come back for more when I
can spare a little time.

One question there: Will the "easy" keyword in roundup be maintained
further, i.e. will new easy bugs be marked in the future? That would be
very useful for neophyte contributors.

What do you mean by "configuration directory"?  IMHO configuration files
on linux/unix should go into ~/.python2.6 or ~/.config/python2.6 or
something like that?

(I would never look in a directory named 'lib' for configuration files.)

One possible issue with enabling it by default could be that
less-experienced users can accidentally break the system configuration
tools written in python used by several linux distros (Ubuntu, Gentoo,
Fedora/Red Hat, ...).

There should be a way for distro developers to make sure the users local
'site-packages' is *not* used when running those tools.

I'd rather have to set/uncomment an environment variable on my system
than having 100 "normal" users break their systems accidentally...   ;-)

There is an option. Those tools should use the -E and -s argument:

Since I was a bit incapacitated yesterday, I continued the bug day
on my own and closed 17 more issues today.

Sadly, the number of open issues is now 1715 since Martin imported
those from SF.net which weren't in the export in the first round.

As was mentioned earlier in the thread. Only $HOME/.local/share was in the
Free Desktop specification. The bin is something that got introduced in this
thread. It makes sense to stick to hier(7) for this sort of thing. Although
the entire concept of a $HOME/.local was new to me as well and is not mandated
at all in POSIX or other circles aside from, apparently, the Free Desktop
folks.

Pendantic note: ~ is an expansion character, the correct variable to talk
about is HOME (see IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004 section 2.5.3 and 2.6.1).

   On most Unicies #! magic may have only one parameter after the program;
the program here is env, the parameter is python, and that's all. Adding
python options will result in different errors - some platforms silently
ignores the options, some reports an error, some tries to find "python -E -s"

IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004:

The shell reads its input from a file (see sh), from the -c option or from the
system() and popen() functions defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE
Std 1003.1-2001. If the first line of a file of shell commands starts with the
characters "#!", the results are unspecified.

   A shell has nothing to do with it as it is the OS (exec system call)
that upon reading the magic of the file sees #! and executes the program
(up to the first space) and pass to the program the first (and the only)
parameter.

#! /usr/bin/env python -O

   [trying to execute the script on Linux]

/usr/bin/env: python -O: No such file or directory

There is (at least) one linux distro using it, but it's not very
well-known.

A solution might be a way for python distributors to set the default
location , and then provide PYTHONUSERHOME for stubborn users to
override that.  ;)

Oh right. I was sure that I've seen a shebang with options somewhere. It
might have been a shell script or a perl script.

Yet another python executable could solve the issue, named "pythons" as
python secure.

/*

   -Xlinker -lpthread -ldl  -lutil -lm -export-dynamic -o pythons2.6

 */

#include "Python.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        /* disable some possible harmful features */
        Py_IgnoreEnvironmentFlag++;
        Py_NoUserSiteDirectory++;
        Py_InteractiveFlag -= INT_MAX;
        Py_InspectFlag -= INT_MAX;

        return Py_Main(argc, argv);
}

Now that I think about it, I'm not sure they use it under $HOME too, but
I was thinking about that distro, yes, as they use such a scheme for the
rest of their system (and it seems natural to do so throughout then).

Most Python developers should the meaning of "~". Should I replace ~
with $HOME for those who don't have as much experience with Unix as we?

   Yes, one can write
#! /usr/bin/python -O
   This works. The OS (exec system call) splits the string into a program
(python) and a single parameter (-O), and python knows how to handle -O.

   The problem with
#! /usr/bin/env python -O
   is that exec splits it into a program (env) and a single parameter
(python -O) and env doesn't know how to run "python -O".

> Yet another python executable could solve the issue

   I doubt it. It is env that doesn't know how to run "python -O" in my
example, not python's problem.

   I don't know if they have a scheme for $HOME.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Priorities in the tracker
Message-ID: <4793961B.6060603@v.loewis.de>

After some months of tracker operation, I'd like to discuss one aspect
of the tracker schema: priorities.

Each issue has a severity and a priority. The severity is assigned by
the submitter, defaults to normal, and indicates how serious the issue
impacts him and the community.

The priority is assigned by a developer (and cannot be set by
a "mere" user), and indicates how quickly this issue must be processed.
The priority is initially unset, requiring a developer to perform screening.

It appears that developers rarely set the priority, leaving the issues
formally unscreened.

So what should we do? Leave things as-is? Drop the notion of priority?
Change our process to make sure priorities do get set (and honored)?

Regards,
Martin

It would appear useful to define some workflow aspects of issue 
processing, for example to ensure that priority gets set by a 
"responsible" reviewer.

However whether such workflow should be imposed by automation or simply 
a discipline of development I'm not in a position to say.

I can't think of a use case for these either, but the first
(limit_denominator) seems like a generalized round, and I suppose
might be useful for something.

In my dream schema, severity becomes difficulty (e.g., easy, medium,
hard, expert), type goes away, and priority changes to be
release-based (e.g., RFE since those can occur whenever, next minor
release, next micro release, immediately, etc.).

I think priority should more be tied to our release cycles than this
generic notion of importance. If it is important, we should try to get
it done by a certain release. Let's have that fact directly reflected
by the tracker.

Christian currently does a good job of assigning the correct properties
to new bugs. In any case, I'd prefer to keep a way to mark a bug as
"high-priority" (meaning that it should be fixed before the next release)
even if most of the bugs don't have an assigned priority.

As to whether we need both severity and priority, I have no opinion.

I've defined the priorities for me:

low = nice to have feature
normal = well ... pretty normal :)
high = important, investigate the bug before the next release gets out
urgent = bug breaks development or is a show stopper
immediate = security issue or major development stopper

This still begs the question which standard APIs should return bytes.

Well, it being a subclass, it doesn't even need to have a flag, right?
The class itself acts as a flag.

But still, without support from built-in and standard library APIs I
fear it's not going to be very useful.

And fixing all the standard APIs to make the correct distinction is
going to create exactly the ripple effect that Raymond so desperately
wants to avoid -- and I agree, to the extent that rippling this
through the stdlib is a waste of time from the stdlib's POV -- it's
already been 3.0-ified.

Personally, I very much doubt there will *be* a 2.7. I certainly don't
expect to participate in its development the same way I am trying to
steer 2.6.

It has to do with instances in a more general sense.

Hm, good point.

At the time, all I cared about were ExtensionClass instances, which  
were akin to modern-day new-style instances.

It doesn't make sense to not call this function for classic instances.

This optimization is fairly useful.  I propose to update the logic to  
call this function for classic instances too.  I'm also open to  
renaming it if that would make people happier. :)

Thoughts?

Since this bug day was a relative success, I suggest to introduce a
more-or-less regular schedule.

Feb 23 would make a nice second bug day in 2008, wouldn't it?

Distro tools shouldn't be using /usr/bin/env in any case. Does

#!/usr/bin/python -E -s

work?

Then how does the user indicate how important it is to him?  My
severities (in an experimental roundup tracker I'm implementing) are
'inelegant', 'inconvenient', 'some work obstructed', 'much work
obstructed', 'security', 'data loss', 'sudden death'.

This is hard to classify with confidence, IMO.  It also means
different things: You could associate it with the set of developers
qualified to handle it, or with the amount of time it would take an
experienced developer to deal with it.  These points of view are
correlated, but I wouldn't be surprised if they have different effects
on the workflow.

 > type goes away,

I'm leaning to this myself, except that I think it is useful to inform
non-developers that some things are organizationally hard.  Eg, a "big
RFE" will require a PEP, while a "big bug" just gets fixed ASAP.

What you're talking about here is what a lot of projects call
milestones.  However, priority is a separate notion, especially for
features.  It indicates which features scheduled for the next
milestone are most likely to get delayed to a later one.

Sure.

Note that if you take everything I said literally and implement it,
you get an unwieldy mess.  Something's gotta go, I expect.  But I
think there are aspects to the "dream schema" you present that are not
going to work as well as you would hope.

No, but

Try `python -h' for more information.

   -Es together work. I think this is why Unix has the tradition of
combining options.

PS. My python doesn't understand -s, so I tested a different options, but
the result is the same. There are Unix variants that understand many
options (I believe FreeBSD allows them) but most allow no more than one
parameter in #!.

We could certainly try to hold one in February. Maybe on the 16th?

For March the best date is probably the Monday of the sprints at
PyCon, because there will be a Python core sprint going.

What would be useful is a method that generates (i.e., a generator in
the Python sense) the (continued fraction) convergents to a rational.
People wanting specific constraints on a rational approximation
(including, but not limited to, the two you identified) can easily
build them on top of such a generator.

By "useful" I don't mean lots of people will use it ;-)  I mean /some/
people will use it -- a way to generate the sequence of convergents is
a fundamental tool that can be used for all sorts of stuff, by those
with advanced applications.

I agree. The other virtue of having it in the standard library is that
it's immediately recognisable for what it is.

FreeBSD 6.3-STABLE:

% ./test.py
Unknown option: -
usage: /usr/local/bin/python [option] ... [-c cmd | -m mod | file | -] [arg]
...
Try `python -h' for more information.

Contracting to -Es works, aside from -s being unknown to my Python.

And also, /usr/bin won't work, FreeBSD uses /usr/local/bin since Python is
installed through ports and is not a system binary.

Yes, you are right. *sigh* It's been too long since I dug around the kernel on
a daily basis.

I had totally forgotten about imgact_shell.c's parsing of the hashbang. As
execve(2) documents on FreeBSD:

  An interpreter file begins with a line of the form:
  
        #! interpreter [arg]
  
  When an interpreter file is execve'd, the system actually execve's the
  specified interpreter.  If the optional arg is specified, it becomes the
  first argument to the interpreter, and the name of the originally
  execve'd file becomes the second argument; otherwise, the name of the
  originally execve'd file becomes the first argument.  The original argu-
  ments are shifted over to become the subsequent arguments.  The zeroth
  argument is set to the specified interpreter.

The problem is that ~ is an expansion character. It expands the contents of
$HOME. If HOME is set to /usr/local, using ~ will expand to /usr/local.

This behaviour is undefined by POSIX, if HOME is null/empty than expanding ~
is undefined. If it is just ~ then it will expand to the contents of HOME, if
~ is followed by a string then it will do a getpwnam() call on the string and
expand that to the initial working directory of said login name string.

HOME is POSIX-mandated to be '[t]he pathname of the user's home directory'.

Interesting. I thought of suggesting something like this, but my
potential use cases are so rare that I couldn't justify it. But as you
say, it's one general building block from which any other desired
functionality can be produced.

Good point. Fundamental tools belong in the library. +1

The -s option is part of my PEP and is not available in the trunk yet.
The arg -Es may work because Python's arg parser doesn't recognize it as
two args -E -s but as the arg -E.

   Thank goodness python is better than that:

$ python -Es
Unknown option: -s
usage: python [option] ... [-c cmd | -m mod | file | -] [arg] ...
Try `python -h' for more information.

$ python -E -s
Unknown option: -s
usage: python [option] ... [-c cmd | -m mod | file | -] [arg] ...
Try `python -h' for more information.

"#!/usr/bin/env python -E -s" doesn't work on most Unices. [1] I came up
with two possible solutions. Both depend on a new 'paranoid' flag -P
which disables several features like PYTHON* env vars, inspect
interactively, user site directory and the '' in sys.path.

* Create a new, minimal Python executable which sets Py_ParanoidFlag to
a true value and calls Py_Main(). The new executable is to be named
pythons2.x (python secure).

* Add a new source flag "# -*- py-paranoid -*-" which must be in the
second or third line of a script. Modules/main.c:Py_Main() checks for
the flag around line 430.

A rough Python version of the C code could look like:

def find_paranoid(fname):
    if not os.path.isfile(fname):
        return
    data = open(fname).read(4096)
    if not data.startswith("#!"):
        return
    for i in (1, 2):
        data = data[data.find('\n'):]
        if data.startswith("# -*- py-paranoid -*-"):
            return True
   return False

"#!/usr/bin/env python -E -s" doesn't work on most Unices. [1] I came up
with two possible solutions. Both depend on a new 'paranoid' flag -P
which disables several features like PYTHON* env vars, inspect
interactively, user site directory and the '' in sys.path.

* Create a new, minimal Python executable which sets Py_ParanoidFlag to
a true value and calls Py_Main(). The new executable is to be named
pythons2.x (python secure).

* Add a new source flag "# -*- py-paranoid -*-" which must be in the
second or third line of a script. Modules/main.c:Py_Main() checks for
the flag around line 430.

A rough Python version of the C code could look like:

def find_paranoid(fname):
    if not os.path.isfile(fname):
        return
    data = open(fname).read(4096)
    if not data.startswith("#!"):
        return
    for i in (1, 2):
        data = data[data.find('\n'):]
        if data.startswith("# -*- py-paranoid -*-"):
            return True
   return False

Good question. I guess there just isn't a clear and precise document available
to point them at. I'll be glad to (help) write such an article.

Yeah, sorry, have not had the time available to verify all cases Christian
reported versus what I can think of. Impending surgery tends to distract the

True. But IMHO Python is still seen as a "difficult" language to 
package. We haven't reached CPAN levels of ease-of-use ye. Yes, I *do* 
know that CPAN isn't perfect, and I think easy_install is a great boon 
to Python users, but CPAN does a great job 98% of the time.

Maybe once we get easy_install as a part of the core (so there's no need 
to find and run ez_setup.py to start with) things will start to improve. 
This is an issue the whole developer community needs to take seriously 
if we are interested in increasing take-up.

setuptools and easy_install won't be included in Python 2.6 and 3.0:

Yes, and yet another release (two releases) will go out without easy 
access to the functionality in Pypi. PEP 365 is a good start, but Pypi 
loses much of its point until new Python users get access to it "out of 
the box". I also appreciate that resource limitations are standing in 
the way of setuptools' inclusion (is there something I can do about 
that?) Just to hammer the point home, however ...

The easy_install utility from setuptools is probably the biggest 
potential recruiter for Python. It makes the language accessible to the 
majority of users who are interested only in acquiring new 
functionality, and not at all in which language that functionality is 
implemented in. Installation of the latest/most appropriate version of 
something then becomes a simple recipe without command switches

Have another look at the rationale given in PEP 365 - it isn't the 
resourcing to do the work that's a problem, but the relatively slow 
release cycle of the core.

By including pkg_resources in the core (with the addition of access to 
pure Python modules and packages on PyPI), we would get a simple, stable 
base for Python packaging to work from, and put users a single standard 
command away from the more advanced (but also more volatile) features of 
easy_install and friends.

Cheers,
Nick.

By the way, if we're actually going to get that into 2.6, it would be 
good for the PEP to actually be approved before then.  :)

With respect to Steve's comments about out-of-the-box usability, it 
should be noted that when you bootstrap a package with pkg_resources, 
it should be possible to include other command-line arguments after 
the package specifier.  So for example:

     python -m pkg_resources setuptools SomePackage==1.2

would download and install setuptools, and run its "bootstrap script" 
with "SomePackage==1.2" as a command-line argument.  And setuptools' 
bootstrap script is basically easy_install with some extra code to 
make sure the setuptools egg gets installed too.

In other words, with PEP 365 in place, "python -m pkg_resources 
setuptools" is basically a way to say "easy_install" without needing 
setuptools installed.

(Heck, if what you really want is to have easy_install support in 
2.6, we could just as easily bundle an easy_install.py that asks for 
an install of setuptools if it's not already present.)

Yes, I noticed it wasn't yet approved and wondered whether this was 
simply an oversight or whether there is still work to do before it can 
be approved.

Well that's probably a simple enough recipe to include in the 
distribution, wouldn't you say?

Would the easiest way to do this be to insert a default dependency on 
setuptools?

Well that's probably a simple enough recipe to include in the

Would the easiest way to do this be to insert a default dependency on 
setuptools?

How about a generator for the convergents in the rational module together
with an example in the documentation showing how to use the convergents to
implement something like trim?

Sorry, I don't understand the question.  What do you mean by "default 
dependency" and to what are you proposing it be inserted?  :)

What I meant was that we could include an easy_install.py whose sole 
function is to ensure that setuptools is installed and then invoke 
the "real" easy_install.  Thus, the first time you ran easy_install, 
a current version would be downloaded, and thereafter the real one 
would be runnable.

Not the only one able - the only one willing to.

People shouldn't complain about the state of things if they aren't

Despite my (well-known) objections to setuptools as the foundation for
the .egg format (and everything that comes with it), I think that would
be a desirable and easy thing to do. Including a setuptools bootstrapper
into the distribution still leaves the choice of actually using
setuptools to the end user.

Martin

[For additional context; the question was regarding where the output
binaries were created for each platform, and specifically if x64 build
should use something like 'PCBuild/x64']

I'm bringing this topic up again as I noticed the AMD64 builds for Python
2.6 create their output in the PCBuild/x64 directory, not directly into the
PCBuild directory.  When I raised this with Christian, he also expressed a
desire to be able to cross-compile in the same directory structure and was
unaware of this discussion (but I made him aware of it :)

You made excellent points about how tools currently recognize the PCBuild
directory, and we can't break them, and I agree.  I'd like to propose a
compromise that might be able to keep everyone happy.

The main problem I see with all platforms using 'PCBuild' is that in a
cross-compilation scenario, it is impossible for the distutils to determine
the location of the correct Python libraries to link with (stuff in its own
PYTHONHOME is no good; it's for the wrong platform).  Obviously, we can
change the distutils so that the location of the correct libraries can be
specified, but that implies all other build systems that currently assume
PCBuild must also change to work in a cross-compilation scenario.  While
those external tools *will* work today in a native build on x64, eventually
they may need to be upgraded to deal with cross-compilation - and this means
that all such tools will also be unable to automatically determine the
location of the libraries.  They will all need to take the library dir as a
user-specified option, which seems a pain (eg, buildbots would seem to need
site-specific configuration information to make this work).  If eventually
all such tools are likely to upgrade, it would be ideal if we can offer them
a way to upgrade so the correct libraries can be determined automatically,
as they can now for native builds.
 
My compromise proposal is this: Each platform builds in its own directory
(ie, PCBuild/x86_64, PCBuild/x86).  Every single build configuration has a
post-build step that copies the result of the build to the PCBuild
directory.  We then add an option to the distutils so that a cross-compile
platform can be specified and when it is, to use 'PCBuild/{platform}"
instead of PCBuild, and we encourage other tools to use the same directory
should they want to support "configure-less" cross-compilation (if distutils
on the trunk is not still trying to maintain b/w compat, it should just
*always* look in PCBuild/{platform}, and I'd suggest py3k not bother with
PCBuild at all; build systems will be touched to upgrade to py3k, so that
change isn't painful.  But I digress :)

The main advantage of the compromise is that it allows for the status quo to
remain in place - just continue to use separate source trees for each
platform, and only ever build a single platform in each tree, and tools are
free to have ways of specifying which directory should be used.  The
official build process need not change.  However, it also supports a way to
do cross-compilation in a way that build tools can *automatically* locate
the correct platform's libraries, and this will be particularly useful for
extension authors.

Would something like that be acceptable?

Thanks,

Mark

I don't really understand what all this has to do with per user
site-packages.

Note that the motivation for having per user site-packages
was to:

 * address a common request by Python extension package users,

 * get rid off the hackery done by setuptools in order
   to provide this.

As such the PEP can also be seen as an effort to enable code
cleanup *before* adding e.g. pkg_resources to the stdlib.

I guess it's a typical case of "while you on it, can you fix the rest of
the world, too?". People see that I invest a fair share of time into the
PEP. So they hope I'm going to solve loosely connected issues, too.

Personally I'm not going to solve every security issue with my PEP. I
suggest that all the people, who were interested in security, come
together and write another PEP.

Setuptools doesn't do any hackery for per-user site-packages, 
although its documentation does explain how to set up such a thing if 
you want it:

http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#administrator-installation
http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#mac-os-x-user-installation

Meanwhile, note that having per-user site-packages directories 
doesn't eliminate the need to be able to have PYTHONPATH directories 
treated as "site" directories, which is hasn't been discussed at all.

Code cleanup of what?  There's nothing in pkg_resources that would 
change for per-user site package directories, since pkg_resources 
doesn't do any installation work.

My guess is that results from the bottom of cmp_outcome (ceval.c),

The default case handles the PyCmp_EQ case via PyObject_RichCompare,
which might not return Py_True or Py_False.

But 'in' is handled inside the switch and is subject to the final
statements:

	v = res ? Py_True : Py_False;
	Py_INCREF(v);
	return v

The issue is that the sq_contains slot is defined as returning an int,
while the tp_richcompare slot is defined as returning a PyObject *.

Your first opportunity for changing this will be Py3k. Please submit a patch!

There are many places in the C implementation where a slot returns an
int rather than a PyObject.  There other replies in this thread seem
to support altering the signature of the slot to return a PyObject.
Is this setting a precedent that _all_ slots should return a PyObject?

Consider the following third behavior:

>>> class foo(object):
...     def __len__(self):
...             return 'foo'
...
>>> x = foo()
>>> len(x)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: an integer is required

Possibly. I guess it depends on the use case. It would be nice to
research this more, e.g. figure out how much code needs to be changed
to make each of these possible changes, and how likely there will be a
use case.

I hope not.

One cost of these hypergeneralizations is that it makes
Python slower.  

Also, it makes it harder to write code when you can no longer
count on simple predicates to return either True or False.


[tomer filiba]
> i see no reason it should behave differently than 
> __eq__ and the rest of comparison operators

The rest of the equality operators were a special case
to allow rich comparisons which were needed to implement
some vector arithmetic idioms.  

It was thought that those use case had enough benefit
to pay for the negative impacts:
* making the language more complex
* slowing everything down a bit.
* complicating the underlying implementation
* making the language more difficult to learn (rich operators
are harder than cmp)

Does making __contains__ return a PyObject have use cases
that are worth those costs?  

It is reminiscent of the ill-fated proposals to overrride 'and',
'or', 'is', and 'is not'.
A couple more questions about the proposal: 

If __contains__ returns 17 in Tomer's example,
what would "8 not in f" return?   

And, would we lose the nice relationship expressed by:

    for elem in container:
        assert elem in container

It looks like changing the semantics would introduce some weirdness.

We've already lost this if anyone really wants to break it::

    >>> class C(object):
    ...     def __iter__(self):
    ...         return iter(xrange(3))
    ...     def __contains__(self, item):
    ...         return False
    ...
    >>> c = C()
    >>> for item in c:
    ...     print item in c
    ...
    False
    False
    False

Of course, anyone who decides to break their container classes in that
way is asking for trouble. ;-)

I think this is in the same category as writing a __hash__ that doens't match __eq__.  It is explicitly shooting yourself in the foot.  

I'm more concerned about introducing an API where well-meaning attempts to code a __contains__ override will implicitly shoot the toes off of client code that innocently assumes a somewhat sensible invariant relation between looping over elements in a container and those elements being in the container.  The code for sets and frozensets makes that assumption, for example.  And, when the code does break, the errors will be darned hard to find.

Message-ID: <ca471dc20801222047n5d56b9d6j3830ea80632adb74@mail.gmail.com>

While the exact release schedule for 2.5.2 is still up in the air, I
expect that it will be within a few weeks. This means that we need to
make sure that anything that should go into 2.5.2 goes in ASAP,
preferably this week. It also means that we should be very careful
what goes in though -- and we should be paying particular attention to
stability on all platforms! Fortunately it looks like quite a few 2.5
buildbots are green: http://python.org/dev/buildbot/2.5/

I propose that anything that ought to go into 2.5.2 (or should be
reviewed for suitability to go into it) should be marked "urgent" in
the tracker, *and* have its version set to (or include) "Python 2.5".

Also, *nothing* should go into the 2.4 branch any more *except*
important security patches. If we're doing a security release, it'll
most likely be a source-only release, and it will differ from 2.4.4
only in that it will have some new security patches defined.

A reminder: 2.5.2 should only get bugfixes, new features.

If Guido felt like dragging the time machine out he would catch his
mistake and have that say "NO new features".

I think that's significantly better than my two proposals. (Looking
back at the issue, I see that Mark mentioned this possibility too and
I just didn't understand him.) I'll plan on implementing that, along
with the documentation Mark suggested, unless there are objections.

Thanks!

It's a typo in the code. It's already fixed in the trunk but it was not
fixed in the 370 branch.

Subject: [Python-Dev] why is mmap a builtin module on windows?
Message-ID: <932f8baf0801222353v2593e6edq556a6fe5a3e25e60@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I want to use the mmap module from python trunk with python 2.5.
On Linux I can easily replace it, as it is a dynamically loaded module. On
windows
it is a builtin module and I fear that I must compile python on windows (or
resort to some other ugly hack)

What is the reason for mmap being a builtin module?

Regards,

On Windows lots of modules are linked into the python main dll. The file
PC/config.c contains a list of all modules. From the point of the
maintainer it's much easier to link the modules into the main dll
instead of creating standalone dlls. I also suspect that it's much
faster because relocation is slow (see PC/dllbase_nt.txt). Martin or
Mark can give you a better answer.

Why do you want to overwrite the existing module instead of using a
different name like ralfmmap?

import ralfmmap as mmap
sys.modules]'mmap'] = mmap

I thought about that (ugly hack) too. I would have to change the imports at
a lot of places (and revert the changes when we switch to python 2.6).
(whereas on Unix I would only have to do install the new mmap module).

It's not an ugly hack, it's a well known feature. Add you don't have to
change a lot of places, too. It's sufficient to add the alias at the
entry point of your application (the script that starts your app). Once
the alias sys.modules]'mmap'] = ralfmmap is set, every import mmap gets
your ralfmmap.

Well, I have multiple scripts using multiple libraries using the new mmap
objects.
So, I would have to change those scripts (if I don't change the libraries),
or change the libraries. And when I want to distribute my apps with bbfreeze
(similar to py2exe), I also need to handle that  import hackery. This is
what I call ugly :) (at least in comparison to linux).

You can also modify site.py and put the hack there.

> I'm more concerned about introducing an API where well-meaning attempts to code a __contains__ override will implicitly shoot the toes off of client code that innocently assumes a somewhat sensible invariant relation between looping over elements in a container and those elements being in the container.  The code for sets and frozensets makes that assumption, for example.  And, when the code does break, the errors will be darned hard to find.


well, i don't see how limiting __contains__ to returning booleans
solves the problem you mentioned. what you're talking about is
*semantics*, and that's always up to the programmer to get right.
allowing __contains__ to return a FooBar object won't change that a
bit -- but it will allow me to construct expression objects more
easily.

and, statements like

if x in y:
    pass

will work as expected, assuming the object returned by
y.__contains__(x) has a proper __bool__/__nonzero__ method. we're just
deferring the type-cast to the point it's actually needed.

as per performance, i don't believe changing a slot method to return
PyObject* instead of int would change anything... am i wrong?

I responded off list to this email and wanted to summarize my response 
for others to peruse.

Basically,  the answer is that the struct syntax proposed for 
multi-dimensional arrays is not intended to mimic how the C-compiler 
handles statically defined C-arrays (i.e. the pointer-to-pointers style 
of multi-dimensional arrays).  It is intended to handle the 
contiguous-block-of-data style of multi-dimensional arrays that NumPy uses.

I wanted to avoid 2-d static arrays in the examples because it gets 
confusing and AFAIK the layout of the memory for a double data[16][4] is 
the same as data[16*4].  The only difference is how the C-compiler 
translates data[4][3] and data[4].

The intent of the struct syntax is to handle describing memory.  The 
point is not to replicate how the C-compiler deals with statically 
defined N-D arrays.  Thus, even though the struct syntax allows 
*communicating* the intent of a contiguous block of memory inside a 
structure as an N-d array, the fundamental memory block is the 
equivalent of a 1-d array in C.

So, I think the example is correct (and intentional).

Subject: [Python-Dev] rfc822_escape doing the right thing?
Message-ID: <51f97e530801230838t472a0d1fv24487c94ee42ca4f@mail.gmail.com>

I've been working on a project that renders PKG-INFO metadata in a
number of ways. I have noticed that fields with any indentation were
flattened out, which is being done in distutils.util.rfc822_escape.
This unfortunately means that you cant use reStructuredText formatting
in your long description (suggested in PEP345), or are limited to a
set that doesn't require indentation (no block quotes, etc.).

It looks like this behavior was intentionally added in  rev 20099, but
that was about 7 years ago - before reStructuredText and eggs. I
wonder if it makes sense to re-think that implementation with this
sort of metadata in mind, assuming this behavior isn't required to be
rfc822 compliant. I think it would certainly be a shame to miss out on
a good thing like proper (renderable) reST in our metadata.

A quick example of what I mean:

>>> rest = """
... a literal python block::
...     >>> import this
... """
>>> print distutils.util.rfc822_escape(rest)

        a literal python block::
        >>> import this

should look something like:

        a literal python block::
            >>> import this


Is distutils being over-cautious in flattening out all whitespace? A
w3c discussion on multiple lines in rfc822 [1] seems to suggest that
whitespace can be 'unfolded' safely, so it seems a shame to be
throwing it away when it can have important meaning.

Perhaps you can add this rationale to the PEP? It seems helpful and
might stave off future confusion.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Is anyone porting PyNumber_ToBase to trunk?
Message-ID: <47976009.5040107@trueblade.com>

In 3.0, the code to implement long.__format__() calls PyNumber_ToBase to 
do the heavy lifting.  If someone is planning on implementing 
PyNumber_ToBase in 2.6, I'll wait for them to do so.  If not, I guess 
I'll either do it myself, or hack around it.

Is this on anyone's To Do list?  I don't see it on Brett's spreadsheet

I'm sure this is because nobody had thought of this detail until now.
Just get started on it. Feel free to add it to the spreadsheet.

Sorry, I do not think so.  If you use a 2-d array in the example, you
must describe it correctly.  The difference between this pep and the old
buffer interface is that the pep allows to describe both how the compiler
sees the memory block plus the size and layout of the memory block, while
the old buffer interface only describes single-segment memory blocks.
And 'double data[16][4]' *is* a single memory block containing a 2-d array,
and *not* an array of pointers.

Here is another typo (?) in the pep; I think it should be changed:

After all, imo there's a lot to do to fully implement the pep for python 2.6.

I guess this one should concern both 2.4 and 2.5 branches.

While the original could be reworded ("product of the elements of the shape 
array"), the amendment is incorrect. For a shape array like {4*5*6}, the number 
of bytes is (4*5*6)*bytes_per_item, not 3*bytes_per_item.

CC to Python Dev

I've fixed that and enhanced the support for NaN and inf for 2.6 and
3.0. I'm working together with Mark on more NaN and inf related fixes
and he has fixed some numerical issues in the cmath module. We both hope
to get Python's math more sound and stable across platforms.

So far I got float('nan'), float('inf') and float('-inf') working on all
platforms. The math module got three new methods: isinf, isnan, copysign.

Additionally the trunk-math branch contains code for inverse hyberbolic
functions (acosh), log1p, Mark's fixes for complex math and more stuff.
For example operations on NaNs now return a NaN on all platforms (except
1**NAN which is defined as 1 and 0**NAN which is defined as 0). In 2.5
it depends on the platform whether a function raises an exception or
returns NaN.

Mark had the nice idea to introduce a thread local or global flag for
NaN support. Depending on a flag Python turns a NaN into an exception.
The feature needs a proper PEP. Maybe Mark has time to write a PEP in time.

Egregious though the error may be I can't myself see that a complete new 
release is justified simply to include a four-line patch in a single 
(not often-used?) module. If it were a buffer overflow it might be 
different (but that would pretty much have to involve a C component).

Couldn't we just publicize the patch? I can't bring myself to believe 
that 1745035 is really "important" enough.

Message-ID: <52dc1c820801231237y7ab70cc4y85a2338fc77498bd@mail.gmail.com>

The documentation for the struct module says:

 http://docs.python.org/dev/library/struct.html#module-struct

 "short is 2 bytes; int and long are 4 bytes; long long (__int64 on Windows)
is 8 bytes"

and lists 'l' and 'L' as the pack code for a C long.

As its implemented today, the documentation is incorrect.  On an LP64 host
(pretty much any 64-bit linux, bsd or unixish thing) a long is 8 bytes.

I assume this means there is existing code out there that expects the
current not-as-documented behavior.  There is also code out there that
expects the documented behavior but behaves wrong when a 64bit Python is
used.

I assume I should just fix the documentation and anything in Lib that uses
the struct module incorrectly (zipfile for example) rather than change the
behavior?

It should go into 2.5 for sure. It should go into 2.4 at the
discretion of the release manager. We *are* considering a
pure-security-fixes source-only release of 2.4 (I wasn't 100% clear on
that in my first mail in this thread).

IMO DoS vulnerabilities are rarely worth getting excited about, unless
they have the potential of bringing down a significant portion of the
internet. This one doesn't.

Actually, that *is* the current answer. That plus a remark
"Contributions are welcome, as long as they
a) come with a clear, objective policy on what should go into
pythonxy.dll and what not, and
b) automate all aspects of adding modules that should not go
into pythonxy.dll according to the policy."

Yes. There has to be a 2.5.2 release and there's no reason to exclude it 
from that.

Ok, its a pretty big diff.  Much of the standard library is completely
broken when used on LP64 platforms.  I added it to the bug.  I'm running
unit tests now.  These fixes should go into 2.5.2.

The diff could use some eyes on it, especially the Mac API stuff that I know
nothing about but am assuming relies on 32bit values.

I'll leave that to MvL to decide; given that AFAIK msilib is only used
to build the Python installer I'm not sure it's worth defending
against malicious code -- it would be easier to simply remove it from
an installation if you have reason to believe you might be executing
malicious Python code.

I'll look into it. msilib is used in distutils (for bdist_msi), so it
should get fixed.

You overlooked the words "Standard size and alignment are as follows"
that start the quoted paragraph.  It's a little confusing because
standard size is not the default.  The default is platform-specific
sizes.  Only if you start the format string with >, <, ! or = do you
get standard sizes.

The reference documentation is correct as it stands, and, I suspect,
so is the LP64 implementation.  Doesn't struct.pack('>l',42) produce a
4-byte string on LP64?

The tutorial at
http://docs.python.org/tut/node13.html#SECTION0013300000000000000000%3E
has a bug though: the format string should use '<'.

I believe zipfile.py correctly uses '<' throughout.

Oh good.  Reading the Modules/_struct.c code I see that is indeed what
happens.  There are still several instances of misused struct pack and
unpack strings in Lib but the problem is less serious, I'll make a new patch
that just addresses those.

The test_winreg failure is a funny one:

The py3k test_winreg fails because of a bug in the test itself; I fixed
this in rev. 60236.  The failing test leaves a key in the registry that
make the trunk and release25-maint tests also fail.

I have manually removed the offending key in the registry on the x86 XP-3
buildbot; we'll see if it works now.

The real solution, however, would be to change all the test_winreg tests
to remove the test-key completely before and after their test.  But I'll
leave this to someone else.

I did quick investigation on this error.

After self._refresh() (line 480 in _loopkup - Lib/mailbox.py) runs,
self._toc contains key like this.
1201171711.M848000P1176Q16.whiterab-c2znlh!2,FR
Please look at exclamation mark. Probably this is not intended on most
platforms like Unix.
It should be ":" colon.

But on windows, ":" is special letter after drive letter. (ex:
"C:/Winnt/foo/bar")
So I imagine open() or something converts ":" to  "!" (valid character as
file name).

After I applied following experimental patch, test_mailbox.py run
successfully on windows.

Sorry, I lied. :-(

open() didn't change ":", test_mailbox.py (TestMaildir.setUp) changed
self._box.colon to "!"

Otherwise, newly created mail box in test_consistent_factory 's "colon" is
":".
This mismatch causes error.

Following patch solves error, but I don't know if this is good solution.

Message-ID: <loom.20080124T151112-964@post.gmane.org>

Recently I was trying to debug an old python program who's maintenance I
inherited.  I was using the quick-and-dirty method of putting some 'print
>>sys.stderr' statements in the code, and then running the command with
'2>filename' appended to the end of the command line.  Imagine my surprise
to see that all of the prompt text from the program's raw_input calls were
also disappearing from the screen output, and appearing in the stderr
output routed to the file.

The latest documentation for raw_input states "If the prompt argument is
present, it is written to standard output without a trailing newline."
I posted a question regarding the observed behavior to comp.lang.python
and Gabriel Genellina (thanks Gabriel!) pointed out that despite the
documentation, raw_input was hard-coded to always output its prompt text
to stderr.

This raises two questions:
1. Shouldn't the current documentation be corrected to state that raw_input
writes its prompt to standard error?
2. Is this really the hard-coded behavior we want?  I don't think my
use-case is that odd; in fact, what I find very odd is that the prompt
output is send to stderr.  I mean, I'm printing the prompt for a question,
not some error message. Can there not at least be an optional parameter to
indicate that you want the output sent to stdout rather than stderr?

I can think of situations where you don't want the output to go to stdout
either (suppose it's the regular output of the file you want to save to a
file).  Having a choice seems the best route.

What about an option (maybe even a default) to send the prompt to stdin?

The Postgres command line interface psql appears to do this:

$ psql 2>&1 >/dev/null
Password:
$

(I typed my password and then I quit by typing ^D; if I type the wrong 
password, it looks the same on screen but it quits right away without 
waiting for ^D)

I think ssh also does this when it needs to prompt for a password.

Really the prompt is part of the input, not part of the output, in a 
certain sense.  Have people actually verified that the prompt is really 
sent to stderr right now by using 2>/dev/null to attempt to suppress it?

   One cannot write to stdin:

>>> sys.stdin.write("1\n")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IOError: [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor

   But it is possible to explicitly open the current console for reading
and writing and do I/O regardless of stdin/stdout/stderr redirects:

>>> tty = open("/dev/tty", "r+")
>>> tty.write("1\n")
1
>>> line = tty.readline()
DDD
>>> line
'DDD\n'

Good point.  On my machine at work (Solaris), Python 2.4 seems to send its
raw_input prompt to stdout, not stderr:

    % python
    Python 2.4.2 (#1, Feb 23 2006, 12:48:31)
    [GCC 3.4.1] on sunos5
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> raw_input("?")
    ?z
    'z'
    >>>
    ink% python 2>/dev/null
    >>> raw_input("?")
    ?sdf
    'sdf'
    >>> ink% python >/dev/null
    Python 2.4.2 (#1, Feb 23 2006, 12:48:31)

    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> raw_input("?")
    wer
    >>> ^D

Same for 2.6a0 on my Mac at home.  Mike, are you sure about it prompting to
stderr?  If so, what's your setup?

Subject: [Python-Dev] trunc()
Message-ID: <20080124133614.AFQ48572@ms19.lnh.mail.rcn.net>

Can anyone explain to me why we need both trunc() and int()?

We used to be very resistant to adding new built-ins and
magic method protocols.  In days not long past, this would
have encountered fierce opposition.

ISTM that numbers.py has taken on a life of its own and
is causing non-essential offspring to sprout-up everywhere.

Also, it seems that ABC is starting to evolve from an optional
tool into something embedded in the language in a way that you
can't escape it.  

I would prefer that it not be on the list of concepts that a
beginner *must* know in order to be functional in the language. 

There are a handful of needs met by the numeric tower but
they only warrant minimal changes to the language.

Raymond


P.S. The docstring for trunc() makes it sound like an imprecisely
specified version of round().


----    trunc() looks like int() but it isn't    ---------------------------

>>> v = [-4.9, -4.5, -4.1, -4.0, -3.5, -0.0, 0.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.1, 4.5, 4.9]
>>> map(int, v)
[-4, -4, -4, -4, -3, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
>>> map(trunc, v)
[-4, -4, -4, -4, -3, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
>>> trunc is int
False
>>> print trunc.__doc__
trunc(Real) -> Integral

returns the integral closest to x between 0 and x.

trunc() has well-defined semantics -- it takes a Real instance and
converts it to an Integer instance using round-towards-zero semantics.

int() has undefined semantics -- it takes any object and converts it
to an int (a concrete type!) using whatever rules it likes -- the
definition of __int__ is up to whatever the source type likes to do.
For float this has been defined the same as trunc() above, but for
other types, who knows! int() of a string does something completely
different.

Perhaps worse is that sometimes int() is lossy (e.g. with a float
input) and sometimes it is not (e.g. with a string input, or with a
non-standard representation of integers). There are still some places
where a float is accepted incorrectly (silently truncating) due to the
use of the __int__ slot. If trunc() had been part of the language from
the beginning we wouldn't have needed to introduce __index__.

Beware: this may depend on whether GNU readline is enabled or not --
under many circumstances, raw_input() calls GNU readline instead of
using sys.stdin/stdout.

I do agree that if there are any conditions where it uses stderr
instead of stdout those are mistakes.

No. trunc calls __trunc__, which does whatever it pleases to do.

>>> class A:
...   def __trunc__(self):
...      return 0
...
>>> a=A()
>>> trunc(a)
0

But why is that a reason to keep trunc()? If you only ever want to
convert floats to ints, you can use either one, with no difference.
int() does *not* have undefined semantics, for floats, it converts
it to an integer using round-towards-zero semantics.

Martin

Skip, Guido and others:

Interesting point about whether GNU readline is installed.  My setup is RedHat
Linux, with Python 2.5 that I built and installed myself.  GNU readline is not,
in fact, installed.  If you look at Python2.5/Parser/myreadline.c, function
PyOS_StdioReadline, line 125, you will see that prompt output is being sent to
stderr.  As best as my Python-fu can determine, this is the code used to output
a raw_input prompt (thanks again to Gabriel Genellina for pointing me in the
right direction.)

It's entirely likely that the difference in what I am seeing and what you guys
are seeing is caused by my not having GNU readline installed.  Nevertheless,
the behavior without it seems wrong, and is certainly different from the
documentation.

However, PEP 3141 specifies what it should do for Numbers.

Yes (although it wasn't always specified this way). But I don't like
that, because of the ambiguity of int(x).

Being that Guido agrees, should I put a bug report into the system for it, and
if so, which should it report as the bug: the actual behavior of the raw_input
prompt when GNU readline is not installed, or the documentation?

IMO the actual behavior is incorrect.

Since something similar is happening to math.ceil and math.floor,
I'm curious why trunc() ended-up in builtins instead of the math
module.  Doesn't it make sense to collect similar functions
with similar signatures in the same place?

It's an implementation detail of PEP 3127 (oct() and bin()), which is on 
the spreadsheet.  I guess I'll have to work on oct() and bin() first.

The spreadsheet notes a possible __future__ statement requirement for 
oct().  The PEP doesn't mention this, and I'm not sure I understand the 
issue.  Any clues?

Traditionally the math module is a tiny wrapper around the system's
libm. Functions for magic hooks like __trunc__ usually end up in
builtins. In this particular case I don't mind where the function is
going to live.

What are the use-cases for when trunc() vs int() should be used, and
for when a class should define __trunc__ vs __int__?

This might help clear up whether both deserve to be a built-in, as
well provide a starting point for 3.0 best practices.

Traditions have gone out the window.  ceil() and floor()
are going to have their signatures changed (Real --> Integral)
and are going to have their own magic methods.  They cannot
be characterized as a thin wrapper around libm.

So the question stands, why is trunc() different?  Can anything
good come from having trunc() and int() in the same namespace?

You can't change the default oct() to return '0o123'; but perhaps you
could import a different version that returned that instead of the
default '0123'.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Float --> Integer Ratio
Message-ID: <20080124181052.AFR00184@ms19.lnh.mail.rcn.net>

rational.py contains code for turning a float into an
exact integer ratio.  I've needed something like this in
other situations as well.  The output is more convenient
than the mantissa/exponent pair returned by math.frexp().

I propose C-coding this function and either putting it in
the math module or making it a method for floats. That 
would simplify and speed-up rational.py while making 
the tool available for other applications.  Also, the
tool is currently in the wrong place (while the output
is clearly useful for rational.py, the internals of
the function are entirely about floats and ints and 
has no internal references to the rational module).

Raymond

def _binary_float_to_ratio(x):
    """x -> (top, bot), a pair of ints s.t. x = top/bot.

    The conversion is done exactly, without rounding.
    bot > 0 guaranteed.
    Some form of binary fp is assumed.
    Pass NaNs or infinities at your own risk.

    >>> _binary_float_to_ratio(10.0)

If you intend to convert a real number (usually float, since Decimal
has decided not to support it) to an Integral (usually int), use
whichever of trunc(), round(), math.floor(), or math.ceil() you
intend. In 2.6, that list only includes trunc(). If you absolutely
need an int (the concrete, not duck type) from an Integral or you want
to parse a string, use int().

Real numbers should define __trunc__. Integrals and, perhaps, some
string-like types (maybe an MD5 class?) should define __int__.

At least, that's my suggestion.

One of my goals for trunc() is to replace the from-float use of int(),
even though we can't remove it for backward-compatibility reasons. PEP
3141 says:

  "Because the int() conversion implemented by float (and by
decimal.Decimal) is equivalent to but less explicit than trunc(),
let's remove it. (Or, if that breaks too much, just add a deprecation
warning.)"

That needs to be updated and implemented. I think the decision was
that removing float.__int__() would break too much, so it needs a
deprecation warning in 3.0.

int has to be a builtin because it's a fundamental type. trunc()
followed round() into the builtins. I have no opinion on whether ceil
and floor should move there; it probably depends on how often they're
used.

So you won't be able to construct an int from a float? That sucks (and 
is unintuitive).

If the ambiguity is that 'int' behaviour is unspecified for floats - is 
it naive to suggest we specify the behaviour?

Yes, you can, but you have to specify how you want it done by using
trunc() or round() or ceil() or floor(). (In 3.0, round(x) will return
an int, not a float.)

The concern is that whatever gets specified is arbitrary. There are many
ways how an int can be constructed from a float, so why is any such way
better than the others, and deserves to be the meaning of int()?

+1. Where do people want it, and what should its name be? I can
implement it if you like.

Another plausible output would be similar to frexp but with an integer
for the mantissa instead of a float. So:
 A) math.frexp(3.2) == (0.80000000000000004, 2)
 B) integral_frexp(3.2) == (3602879701896397, -50)
 C) exact_integral_ratio(3.2) == (3602879701896397, 1125899906842624)

(B) is easier to implement in C (not that that's a deciding factor);
(C) is probably more useful. So I'd vote for (C), your suggestion, but
just wanted to make the choice explicit.

Also, to make things explicit, the implementation in rational.py
doesn't guarantee that the fraction is in lowest terms. Should the
library version?

I'd say anything that is needed by "import sys, os" is a candidate for being
included.
Currently even the _csv module is a builtin module on windows. But then I
don't know how much slower importing from a .pyd file is..

It's not that simple. You also have to integrate it into the build and
carefully arrange the dependencies. You also have to find a free and
sensible base address for the dll. At last the new modules must be
integrated into the MSI installer script.

What I understand here is as int() is "ambiguous", in the future if
you want to specify how you want to convert a float to int.

But ceil and floor returns a float. And round and trunc will return an
int. So, how I could convert a float to its upper int? Like this?:

>>> trunc(math.ceil(.3))
1

BTW, int is not giving me a deprecation warning:

>>> int(.1)
0

Thanks!

It seems strange to me that a release that has the avowed intention of 
producing a "more rational" language by breaking backwards compatibility 
should start out with deprecation warnings of this type.

What's next: "This isn't Perl" when someone tries to add a number and a 
string?

Surely the place to raise warnings is in 2to3.

Suggestion:

- int() has to stay in builtins for obvious reasons.
- put *all* of trunc, ceil, floor, round into math.
- make int(float) an error

The only fly in the ointment is that 2to3 can't handle the semantic
issues around converting int(n) to math.trunc(n) because it can't
detect the type of n. So why not make int(float) warn in -3 mode on
2.6, and then let 2to3 do the conversion (on the basis that 2to3
should only be run on code that is -3 warning free)?

Did I miss a requirement here?

Paul.

-0 (you should be able to convert between builtin datatypes without
the use of a module). +1 to keep it and define exactly the behaviour,
and point to math module in the documentation if you want better
control over the conversion.

Slightly different suggestion:
 - define int(float) as int(trunc(float))

In my humble opinion lots of people expect int(-2.5) == -2 and int(2.5)
== 2. Or in other words: int(float) chops of the digits after the dot.

As far as I can see float.__int__ already behaves like int(trunc(float))

>>> for n in (2.4, 2.6, -2.4, -2.6):
...     print(n, (math.floor(n), math.ceil(n), round(n), trunc(n), int(n)))
...
Python 3:0

 2.4 ( 2,  3,  2,  2,  2)
 2.6 ( 2,  3,  3,  2,  2)
-2.4 (-3, -2, -2, -2, -2)
-2.6 (-3, -2, -3, -2, -2)

Python 2.6:
 2.4 ( 2.0,  3.0,  2.0,  2,  2)
 2.6 ( 2.0,  3.0,  3.0,  2,  2)
-2.4 (-3.0, -2.0, -2.0, -2, -2)
-2.6 (-3.0, -2.0, -3.0, -2, -2)

FWIW, this approach gets a +1 from me (although I'm -0 on taking round() 
out of builtins - that seems like a pointless incompatibility to me).

Yes, blessing 'trunc' as the default mechanism for converting a 
non-integral number to an integer is somewhat arbitrary, but it's a 
piece of arbitrariness with a very long history behind it.

For that matter, we could even formally define int() as falling back to 
trunc() if there is no direct conversion (i.e. int knows about the type 
natively, or the type provides an __int__ method). That way non-integral 
types could just implement __trunc__ without having to worry about 
adding "__int__ = __trunc__" to the class definition.

We would still have operator.index to identify types which can be 
losslessly converted to a builtin integer.

Cheers,
Nick.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Simple syntax proposal: "not is"
Message-ID: <faf2c12b0801250813n5b0b38eepe71944b6016224db@mail.gmail.com>

I'm writing a source code editor that translates identifiers and keywords
on-screen into a different natural language. This tool will do no
transformations except at the reversible word level. There is one simple,
avoidable case where this results in nonsense in many languages: "is not". I
propose allowing "not is" as an acceptable alternative to "is not".

Obviously English syntax has a deep influence on python syntax, and I would
never propose deeper syntactical changes for natural-language-compatibility.
This is a trivial change, one that is still easily parseable by an
English-native mind (and IMO actually makes more sense logically, since it
does not invite confusion with the nonsensical "is (not ...)"). The
use-cases where you have to grep for "is not" are few, and the "(is
not)|(not is)" pattern that would replace it is still pretty simple.

-1.  There should be one obvious way to do it.  And honestly, if
you're dealing with natural language, and your system is not able to
change word order words between languages, you're in a lot of trouble
already.

Your editor is going to have to deal with code written the normal way 
anyway - given that this is a pretty special case, the special handling 
should stay in the tool that needs it (your editor) not in the 
programming language.

As you say, Python is heavily influenced by English, and in English "a 
not is b" is out-and-out nonsense (there is no way to build a coherent 
parse tree with that word order), while "not a is b" and "a is not b" 
both make sense (although you are correct in pointing out that the 
latter is technically ambiguous as an English phrase).

"is not" and "not in" are just normal binary operators that happen to 
consist of two words in the concrete syntax - your editor is going to 
need to be able to deal with that (even if that means having to handle 
translations that span multiple words).

Cheers,
Nick.

Like this, in 3.0:

3

There was a previous thread in which we decided not to change that

Correct; that's not implemented yet.

I'd deal with Facundo's objection that you should be able to convert
between builtin datatypes without the use of a module by leaving trunc
in the builtins, but it looks like I'm in the minority here. If the
decision comes to be that int(float) should be blessed as a correct
way to truncate a float, I'd agree with Raymond that trunc() is just
duplication and should be eliminated. I'd, of course, rather have a
spelling that says what it means. :)

I'd be happy with that too.

Mmm... no. int() is a builtin way to transform the builtin data type
float into the builtin data type float.

There's no "correct" way for a float to become an integer, but in the
math module you have several ways to do it (floor, ceil, round, trunc,
choose the one that you want, but you're "notified" <wink/2> that
there're different ways to do it).

I assume you meant "int" instead of your second "float".

There doesn't have to be a way to convert from every builtin type to
every other builtin type. Take dict(float), for example. Further, if
there is a conversion, no law says it has to be named the same as the
target type. If there are two plausible ways to get from the source to
the target, using just the target's name to pick out one of them is
really a terrible idea.

But, just because the designers of C made a bad decision that we've
inherited, doesn't mean that it's a terrible idea to keep it. As Nick
said, defining int(float) as truncation has a long history, and there
are some obvious costs to breaking away from that. I think it is time
to correct the mistake, but it's not an open and shut case.

Sorry, but this use case just doesn't sound strong enough to change a
programming language's grammar.

While I promise you I will remain -1 on the proposal simply because it
doesn't serve any programmer's goals, you've piqued my curiosity --
can you give an example of what your tool does? From your description
I actually have no clue.

In keeping with this theme, why not define int() for floats (and other
real types) as

def __int__(n, method=math.trunc)

or something similar, so that, by default, int() provides the same
functionality as before (or whatever is decided to be preferred, I'm
making no judgements on that end), but has a way --- by passing a
different function --- of changing the way it rounds?  The other
(probably preferred) option, I suppose, would be to provide a few
constants (float.FLOOR_METHOD et al.) instead of passing an arbitrary
function (which, of course, makes me a bit uncomfortable).

I wouldn't fret about this too much.  Intrepreting int(f) as
meaning truncate has a *long* history in *many* programming
languages.  It is a specious argument int(f) is ambiguous.  
No one thinks it means ceil(f).  

Go ask a dozen people if they are surprised that int(3.7) returns 3.
No one will be surprised (even folks who just use Excel or VB). It
is foolhardy to be a purist and rage against the existing art:

SQL: "The INT() function returns its numeric argument with any fractional
digits removed and truncates all digits to the right of the decimal
point."
www.basis.com/onlinedocs/documentation/b3odbc/bbjds_int_function.htm 

VB: "Both the Int and Fix functions remove the fractional part of
Number and return the resulting integer value."
http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xh29swte.aspx

Excel: "The Int function returns the integer portion of a number."
http://www.techonthenet.com/excel/formulas/int.php

These docs suggest where the thinking has gone wrong.  Writing int(f)
doesn't mean "arbritrary select one of round|ceil|floor|trunc as
a way of getting to an integer"; instead, it means "return the
integer portion (non-fractional component) of a number."  The
latter definition seems common and is entirely unambiguous.

Does no-one thinks it means round(f) either? That's the main confusion
here (plus the fact that in C it's undefined -- or at some point was
undefined).

BTW the list of functions considered here should include round() in
addition to ceil(), floor(), and trunc(), even if 2-arg round()
doesn't quite fit.

Am I the only one who wonders about the sudden change in decimal significance?
Especially given the fact that the ISO C standard specifies floor(), for
example, as returning a floating point value and the above in Python 3.0
deviates to just returning an integer. Which is also different from 2.5's
behaviour.

Can I assume we are all familiar with the concept of significant digits and
that we agree that from this point of view 2 != 2.0? And that results such as
the above would be a regression and loss in precision?

   I don't think so. I often emulate round(f) as int(f + 0.5).

Well, for what it's worth, here are MySQL's own two cents:

mysql> create table t (a int);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> insert t (a) values (1.4), (1.6), (-1.6), (-1.4);

Not that I think my opinion will have any weight in this discussion,  
but I'd agree that int has a long history not likely to be  
misinterpreted when applied to real numbers.

Quoting from Graham, Knuth and Patashnik "Concrete Mathematics...2nd  
edition" page 67:

"We start by covering the floor (greatest integer) and ceiling (least  
integer) functions, which are defined for all real x...

...some pocket calculators have an INT function, defined as floor(x)  
when x is positive and ceil(x) when x is negative. The designers of  
these calculators probably wanted their INT function to satisfy the  
identity INT(-X) = -INT(X). But we'll stick to our floor and ceiling  
functions, because they have even nicer properties than this."

That's the mathematical definition.  The way they explain
it is dirt simple:  return the integer portion of a number.

Some of the calculators that have int() also have frac()
which has the obvious interpretation.

"not is" makes no sense to -- and is not easily parsed by -- my
English-native mind.

Heck no.  The int() and round() functions have been in Lotus and Excel for an eternity and nobody has a problem learning what those functions do.

Also, the extra argument for round(f, n) makes it clear that it can return other floats rounded to n-digits.

I've taught a lot of classes to spreadsheet users and have observed that people get it right away.

Two points. Firstly, regarding MySQL as authoritative from a standards 
point of view is bound to lead to trouble, since they have always played 
fast and loose with the standard for reasons (I suspect) of 
implementation convenience.

Second, that example isn't making use of the INT() function. I was going 
to show you result of taking the INT() of a float column containing your 
test values. That was when I found out that MySQL (5.0.41, anyway) 
doesn't implement the INT() function. What was I saying about standards?

Not me. My intuition agrees with Raymond that int means "the integer
part of", i.e. trunc(), when dealing with a numeric argument.
(int(string) is a different matter, and I have no problem having
different intuitions for that. So sue me)

I'd like to keep trunc (as math.trunc) for those cases where I want to
be completely explicit, but it's not a big deal to me.

My original message suggested that round go into math as well. It
didn't get much comment, though, as everyone latched onto the more
controversial suggestion that int(float) be an error - which is the
bit I was least concerned about, ironically.

FWIW, here's what IBM has to say to this:

    http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.db2.udb.admin.doc/doc/r0000814.htm

    """If the argument is a numeric-expression, the result is the same number that would occur if the argument were
assigned to a large integer column or variable. If the whole part of the argument is not within the range of integers,
an error occurs. The decimal part of the argument is truncated if present."""

AFAIK, the INTEGER() function is not part of the SQL standard, at
least not of SQL92:

    http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt

The way to convert a value to an integer is by casting it to
one, e.g. CAST (X AS INTEGER). The INT() function is basically
a short-cut for this.

To that I heartily agree. I was just pointing out that implicit conversion
of float to int did not always use the moral equivalent of trunc() under
all programming platforms. That said, I don't think it's that important,
it's just something you have to learn.

All of the abstract base classes should be collected in one place.  I propose that the modules be collected into a package so that we can write:

   import abc.numbers
   import abc.collections
    . . .

Besides collecting all the relevant code in one place, it has a nice additional benefit of clearly designating when you're working with one of the provided abstract base classes.  When I see "import numbers", I don't immediately recognize this as being somehow different from "import math" or some other concrete implementation.

IMO. the emerging practice of spreading modules these across the library isn't serving us well.

 I don't think so. Things should be grouped by application area, not
by some property like "uses metaclasses" or "defines abstract base
classes" or "overrides operators". The old types module collected all
"built-in types" and it was a mistake. You  might as well propose that
all decorators should live in the same package, or all generic
functions (if we ever have them). There's a lot more synergy between
the collection ABCs and other collections than between collection ABCs
and number ABCs.

Another angle: the io.py module also uses ABCs. Should it therefore be
a subpackage of ABC? No way!

If you want ABCs to be more easily recognizable as such, perhaps we
could use a naming convention, though personally I think we don't need
that either -- the generic names like "Sequence" or "Real" are enough
of a tip-off that these are type categories and not implementation
types.

Essentially, that's all I was asking for.  It doesn't
really matter to me whether numbers.py gets called
abc_numbers or abc.numbers.  Either one would be an
improvement.

abstract_numbers would seem to express the essence without focusing on 
the mechanism unduly. Of course no sane person would suggest using a 
keyword, like

    import abstract numbers

Wouldn't want to let reader know what was going on ...

Not really, because if someone cares about precision to that extent they 
won't be using binary floats anyway (they'll be using Decimal, or 
something like it). Besides, for trunc, ceil and floor, it's all zeroes 
after the decimal point by definition (no matter how many significant 
digits you started with).

I think the module level is the wrong granularity to be thinking about 
this - look at a module like collections, which contains not only ABC's 
related to containers, but also some useful concrete containers like 
deque and namedtuple.

Any naming convention would have to be at the class level. For example:

class NumberABC(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    ...

class ComplexABC(NumberABC):
    ...

class RealABC(ComplexABC):
    ...

class RationalABC(NumberABC):
    ...

class IntegralABC(RationalABC):
    ...

I think adopting such a convention (at least for the standard library) 
would actually be useful. Normally, finding isinstance() type checks in 
code bothers me severely as it usually indicates that duck-typing has 
been broken. On the other hand, if I find a check in code that does 
something like:

   if not isinstance(x, NumberABC):
      raise TypeError("Not a number!")

it would clearly still be extensible, as I would know just from the 
naming convention that a third party can register their type with 
NumberABC to make it usable with this function.

Without a naming convention, I would always have to go check the 
definition of the type in the isinstance() call to see if the code was 
legitimate.

Cheers,
Nick.

That's a good point. Someone already convinced me to name the test for
numbers.py, test_abstract_numbers.py, so renaming the module makes
sense too, although I agree that collections, which contains some
concrete classes, should keep its current name. If others agree, want
to send a patch?

I'm not so worried about the name of the numbers module, but if Guido 
likes the idea of a standard naming convention (such as the ABC suffix) 
for classes that use the ABCMeta metaclass, I'd certainly be happy to go 
through and update the affected classes and the code which refers to them.

Cheers,
Nick.

Not me.  Int should truncate, so trunc() not needed unless is does 
something different.

 And I would prefer the float-input-only converters be in math.  There is 
nothing second-class, really, about functions in modules.  Just more 
specific.

Decades of usage, in English, with the meaning it already has in Python.

So, the problem is basically this:

       Since int(o) must return an int, you're precluded from defining
       a new Real class with an __int__()  method that returns an instance
       of some new Integral class that isn't an int.

And the proposed solution is:

       Introduce trunc(o) which calls o.__trunc__() which can return
       any Integral type.  And, client code must use trunc() instead of
       int(); otherwise, the two new numeric types won't be exercised.

Is that basically what trunc() is all about -- a variant of int() that can
return something other than an int type -- something that behaves
just like the new math.floor() for positive numbers and math.ceil()
for negative numbers?

If so, I think we would be *much* better-off leaving trunc() out 
entirely and seeing if any use cases arise that aren't handled by
math.floor() and math.ceil() with their precise semantics, 
unambigous naming, and ability to handle generic Reals and Integrals.

The existence of trunc() clashes so severely with existence of int(),
that we need to be damned sure that there are real-world, worthwhile
problems that are not readily solved with floor() and ceil() for rounding
Reals into Integrals or with int() for making ints from the non-fractional
portion of a float.

That, and making int(float) == int(trunc(float)) seems like reasonable
behavior to me as a person not involved in the discussion.

Are you planning to backport bytearrays?  I thought we had clearly decided to *not* backport any of the text/bytes model so that the 
Py2.6 string/unicode model remained pure.

Guido proposed a couple of harmless aliases for annotation purposes (to help the 2-to-3 tool do the right thing) and that was it. 
Your reply was:

       > Ah, you like to keep it simple. The aliases are easily to implement.

How did we get from two simple aliases to plans for backporting major chucks of the new model?  I'm not seeing any limits on 
Py3.0-->Py2.6 contamination.

This has been fairly widely reported - and in fact is on the front page 
of Python.org!

A site with a more interesting range of metrics (in my opinion) is 
'langpop':

http://www.langpop.com/

In its 'Normalized Comparison' it shows Python doing well, but not 
*quite* having overtaken Perl yet.

All the best,

Like returning a value of the same type as the input? int(), being a 
call to a type, should never return a value of another type.

I initially thought that, but found the suffix to be the least annoying 
of the ideas I had for denoting abstract base classes. To try and give 
some idea of how I came to that conclusion I've listed some of the other 
ideas I had below (again using the numeric stack as an example).

INumber
IComplex
IReal
IRational
IIntegral
   Using a simple 'I' prefix annoys me for cases like the last one where 
the class name actually starts with an I, and 'interface' is a bit of a 
misnomer for abstract base classes anyway - they have a lot in common, 
but they're not the same thing. This is also an existing convention for 
things like zope.interface, so probably not a good idea to adopt to mean 
something else.

ABCNumber
ABCComplex
ABCReal
ABCRational
ABCIntegral
   I find using the ABC acronym as a prefix ends up with too many 
capitals together at the start of the word and it becomes far more 
obtrusive than it needs to be. The main thing about these classes is 
what they represent - the fact that they're ABC's, while still 
significant enough to indicate somewhere in the name, should be of 
secondary importance.

AbcNumber
AbcComplex
AbcReal
AbcRational
AbcIntegral
   This one bugs me mainly because I don't like lowercasing letters in 
acronyms just to try and fit in with a camel-casing scheme. It's just ugly.

After those 3, I couldn't think of any other prefixes that were both 
short and likely to be an effective mnemonic for identifying ABC's - 
Abstract is too long, Abs is far too easy to associated with 'absolute' 
instead of "Abstract base class", etc.

Which lead me to the idea I actually used in my earlier post:

NumberABC
ComplexABC
RealABC
RationalABC
IntegralABC

That way the normal class names are still front and centre, with a short 
annotation tacked on to the end to say "oh, by the way, this happens to 
be an abstract base class".

I'm not sure any more discussion will be particularly useful though - 
any convention that gets adopted is going to be by Guido's fiat and will 
need to suit his aesthetic sense rather than mine :)

Cheers,
Nick.

The idea raised when I was working on a backport of the io module. The
io module requires a mutable byte type. Guido answered a question in my
issue http://bugs.python.org/issue1919

Backporting bytearray should be relatively clean since it's a brand new
type right?

My initial question was:

I'm not sure how to proceed with the missing bytearray type:

 * backport bytearray and the new buffer interface from 3.0
 * write a replacement for 2.6
 * replace the bytearray code with new code

bytearray is a new type that has no equivalent in Python 2.6. Python
3.0's byte type is basically a modified string type. I don't see a
problem with bytearray, do you?

Sorry to burst your bubble, but 'is' and 'not' are two separate
tokens; the grammar handles this by giving unary 'not' a priority
lower than comparison operators.

'bytearray' is a separate issue. It's a brand new type: a *mutable*
byte array. Its status as a built-in and completely different API
makes it much more convenient than using the old array module.
Introducing bytearray is not going to disturb the balance between
str/bytes/unicode.

I'm looking forward to having a native mutable bytes type in Python 2.x.

Incodentally, I think your example is wrong.  It should be either

psql >/dev/null 2>&1

or

psql &>/dev/null

Notice the reversal of redirects in the first one.

Of course, this doesn't change anything about the core discussion...

This interpretation implies that complex should provide __float__() to

No, please don't. If somebody wants to implement __float__ for complex
numbers please define it as hypot(complex) / sqrt(c.real**2 + c.img**2).

In my opinion float(complex) does do the most sensible thing. It fails
and points the user to abs().

That's the only position in this discussion that I don't understand.
Although int() and trunc() would still have very slightly different
behaviors, they seem too close together (identical on most common
types) to be compatible with "only one way to do it". I've been
advocating trunc() under the assumption that int(float) would be
deprecated and eliminated as soon as practical (with an error message
similar to float(complex)). Could one of the people in favor of
keeping both explain why they think that's a good idea?

And how much code would break for basically zero benefit?

This position is totally nuts.

There is *nothing* wrong with int() as it stands now.  Nobody has
problems with it.  The tools is ubiquitous in other languages,
spreadsheets, and calculators.

To elaborate the point I was trying to make: If float() does not mean
"the float part of" and should not take a complex argument (which I
completely agree with), then int() does not mean "the int part of" and
should not take a float argument.

Even assuming that's correct, I'm not certain that it's worth breaking
(well, deprecating) backwards compatibility to achieve a more
consistent set of functions in this case. I think it is, but I'm happy
to leave that point up to the rest of the list (which does seem to be
leaning against it).

Message-ID: <ee2a432c0801261705l78e5e2d1v890c0ffb3d21efc4@mail.gmail.com>

Around Jan 13, the refleak hunting test that is reported on
python-checkins started to report refleaks on virtually every run.  I
suspect this is due to r59944 (at 2008-01-13 16:29:41) which was from
patch #1700288 to cache methods.  With this patch it makes it much
harder to spot refleaks.  Does anyone have ideas how to fix it?  The
only one I have is to disable the cache with a special flag, env't
variable, sys variable/function or the like.  We could make this
available only in debug mode.  The cache should normally be enabled,
but could be disabled solely on the refleak runs.

Suggestions?

The 'float part' of a complex number is meaningless since both components 
of a complex are floats (in practice, or reals in theory).  The same is 
true in polar representation.

The 'integer (int) part' of a float/rational/real is established thru

antecendent.

We'll see.  Jeffrey did say "deprecated" and "as soon as practical". A

Hold it right there. You may disagree, but that doesn't make it nuts.

There is actually quite an important signal to the reader that is
present when you see trunc(x) but absent when you see int(x): with
trunc(x), the implication is that x is a (Real) number. With int(x),
you can make no such assumption -- x could be a string, or it could be
a totally different type that happens to define __int__, perhaps a
custom date/time type (I believe mxDateTime supports this).

Talk to C++ experts. They have a huge beef with C's confusing use of
casts for two different purposes: reinterpretation of the same bit
pattern vs. value conversion. Python problem isn't quite the same, but
I still really wish I had followed Pascal's lead instead of C's here:
Pascal requires you to use trunc() to convert a real to an integer.
(BTW Pascal also had the division operator right, unlike C, and we're
finally fixing this in Py3k by following Pascal's nearly-40-year-old
lead.) If we had done it that way, we wouldn't have had to introduce
the index() builtin and the corresponding infrastructure (__index__
and a whole slew of C APIs).

> spreadsheets, and calculators.

I don't think that Excel should be held up as a shining example for
Python. At least, that would be quite a change.

>. You may disagree, but that doesn't make it nuts.

Too many thoughts compressed into one adjective ;-)

Deprecating int(float)-->int may not be nuts, but it is disruptive.

Having both trunc() and int() in Py2.6 may not be nuts, but it is duplicative and confusing.

The original impetus for facilitating a new Real type being able to trunc() into a new Integral type may not be nuts, but the use 
case seems far fetched (we're never had a feature request for it -- the notion was born entirely out of numeric tower 
considerations).

The idea that programmers are confused by int(3.7)-->3 may not be nuts, but it doesn't match any experience I've had with any 
programmer, ever.

The idea that trunc() is beneficial may not be nuts, but it is certainly questionable.

In short, the idea may not be nuts, but I think it is legitimate to suggest that it is unnecessary and that it will do more harm 
than good.


> I don't think that Excel should be held up as a shining example for
> Python.

It is simply a datapoint.  We don't care why they chose int() for
truncation.  The important thing is the subsequent user experiences
which indicates that people do not have a problem with it.
When it comes to int() and round(), people just get it.
I've taught spreadsheets to a lot people and no one has ever
construed int() as meaning round().  What was your experience
with 18 years of python? Was it a recurring a point of confusion?
On the newsgroup, helplist, and tutorial list, I never seen this
come up as problem.

I looked in other places for corroboration.  My HP-12C has
intg and frac buttons.  In BASIC, int() means to return the
integer part of a floating point number.  The surprise find
was that int() in Matlab and Maple means integrate :-)
FWIW, Perl's int() does what ours currently does.

One other thought:  In Python, it has been nice that we have simple type coercions using the type name:
* set(p)-->q    can accept a list, tuple, string, or any iterable and make a set
* int(p)-->q     can accept an int, long, float, or string and make an int
* float(p)-->q  can accept an int, long, float, or string and make an int
* list(p)-->q    can accept a list, tuple, string, or any iterable and make a list
* unicode(p)--> can accept a str, buffer, or unicode object and make a unicode object
It's a bit weird to decide that int() needs to lose that capability so we get generalized Integrals as output.  What's wrong with 
coercion to a concrete type?

In C, I'm pretty sure I've seen people write (long)x where they'd have
been better off with lround(x). They know that the cast truncates, and
generally that they actually wanted to round, but the type they wanted
to get to was foremost in their mind, so they didn't bother to think
about it a little and write what they really wanted. It's not that
they're confused; it's that they're accepting a default that shouldn't
be a default.

Your other points seem to have been answered already, although people
will disagree on how compelling the answers are, so I won't repeat
them here.

This will be a bikeshed argument until Guido speaks out his
preference/decision I guess.

But isn't it a more common solution to name the base class just Number and
derive from it by means of using Base.Number or something similar? Looks
cleaner to me rather than all these odd looking pre- or suffixes. (I am not
charmed about ABC in the name at all to be honest, doesn't really give me a
Python feeling.)

Let me get back to you on that.

I first want to point out that you snipped the core of my argument in
the post you otherwise quoted. I will repeat it here because I would
like your explicit reaction:

[Guido]
> There is actually quite an important signal to the reader that is
> present when you see trunc(x) but absent when you see int(x): with
> trunc(x), the implication is that x is a (Real) number. With int(x),

Can I assume that you agree with this? That would be progress.

Coming back to your argument that other types have a constructor that
takes all kinds of arguments, I'd like to point out that they all have
restrictions too (except for str()): list() and tuple() only accept
iterables, float() only accepts strings and certain numbers (not
complex), and so on. Taking the latter as an example:

>>> float(0j)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: can't convert complex to float; use abs(z)
>>>

I think that (eventually) int(0.0) could do something similar:

>>> int(0.0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: can't convert float to int; use round(x) or trunc(x)
>>>

But see below.

Yet another (minor) argument that has always made me uncomfortable
with int() == trunc(): the % operator. I think it's a big improvement
over C that Python's % operator is defined as

x%y == x - y*floor(x/y)      # where / is real division

rather than C's division, which uses trunc() instead of floor(). In C
this nicely meshes with the definition of int(): you can define x%y as
x - y*(int)(x/y); but not so in Python. I don't want to use this as an
argument for defining int(x) as floor(x), but I do want to point out
that it has always given me a twinge of discomfort.

FInally, there's the "one way" argument. That's a nice slogan, but
doesn't really hold anyways in practice. To copy a list, we can write
either L[:] or list(L). To get the keys of a dict, we can write either
D.keys() or list(D). To convert a number to a string we can write
either "%g" % X or str(X). For octal we can write "%#o" % X or oct(X).
To convert a unicode string to UTF-8, we can write either
U.encode("utf8") or str(U, "utf8"). And so on. In many cases, these
notations aren't exactly the same in semantics (e.g. list(X) always
returns a list, X[:] returns whatever sequence type X is), but
nevertheless they have large areas of overlap. This is how I see
trunc() and int() live together.

After all that, here's my current proposal:

- Deprecating int(<float>) is pretty radical, I think it would have to
happen in the distant future. OR not at all. I'm at best +0 on this,
more like exactly 0. I realize that in practice this kills the idea.
The "purist" argument for it would have worked better if it was made
18 years ago.

- trunc(), round(), floor() and ceil() should all be built-ins,
corresponding to __trunc__, __round__, __floor__ and __ceil__. Then we
have the four standard ways to go from Reals to Integers, which are
properly extensible for folks who write their own number types. (We
can't control how folks implement __round__, but we can document
expected behavior -- that's how we treat __add__ and all other
operators too, after all.)

- In the docs (especially for beginners) we recommend that users write
trunc() instead of int(), emphasizing that trunc() ensures the
argument is a number, while suggesting int(x) for conversion from
strings. But the implementation won't chastise users by issuing
annoying warnings.

My preference is still *not* to use a naming convention. I just
suggested it as a lesser evil compared to segregating all abstract
base classes in an "abc" package ghetto. I really don't see why names
like "Number" or "MutableSequence" would need any additional help to
make the reader see they are abstract.

I note that at least for built-in types there will be the naming
convention that concrete implementation classes are all lowercase,
like int, float, list, namedtuple, defaultdict, and so on, while the
ABCs all have a Capitalized[Words] name: Hashable, Number, Real,
MutableMapping, etc.

Also what happens with "%i" % 3.14 ? We incidentally found a problem
with a script using python 2.5 because apparently the "%" formatting
operator doesn't use "int()" for doing the conversion (to be more specific
if the float is too large for a 32-bit integer then the format operator chokes
while the int() operator returns a long).
Anyway I want just to say that if "implicit" conversion from float
to integer goes away then what happens to formatting conversion ?
Removing that too IMO would break a lot of code and it's IMO very
difficult to help fixing that.

Of course, those floating point repr questions are common, but that wasn't the issue here.

The trunc() protagonists are contending that the int(f) function will be confused with the round(f, n) function. I've never seen 
than come up, ever.

Well, it seems like it would be as easy to make some formatting
conversions raise a warning on float inputs as it would be to make
int() do it. But I think you're safe here; it doesn't look like either
will be deprecated.

I agree that it provides a cue that that input is Real.
I don't agree that that has any value. We had a lot of tools that
can accept multiple input types.  For instance, float() can accept
a string or number.  We could do like C and split-out the atof()
functionality but that just makes two functions where one would suffice.

It hasn't bugged me much, but I do understand.

"pretty radical" is what I meant when I said "it's nuts" ;-)

This is a major piece of progress. Most of the prior proposal was 
predicated on int(<float>) being deprecated.

ISTM, you really don't need trunc() in this mix.  The ceil() and floor()
functions do an excellent job of convering most use cases.

The overlap of trunc() and int() just isn't worth it.  There's the mental
cost of having to explain the difference on day one to every beginner.
There's the back end cost of every class that has __int__ also needing
to decide whether to provide __trunc__ which will typically be the 
same thing.  

In time, I believe it will become self-evident that having both int() 
and trunc() is a wart.  If trunc() goes into 2.6 and 3.0, then we're
going to have to live with this for a long time.

Purity may suggest that you need trunc(). Practicality says it isn't
worth the cost.

At least we've made important progress by saving int(<float>).

That's quite a separate issue. Please ses http://bugs.python.org/issue1742669.

The formatting code could assign specific meanings. I suspect though
that it was never meant to be possible to use %d with a float -- it
just is one of the artifacts of using implicit conversion, and one not
well-thought through. Note:

>>> "%.0f" % 3.9999999999
'4'
>>> "%d" % 3.9999999999
'3'
>>>

I think the latter is wrong and confusing.

Is this a valid summary of the arguments so far?

I see two arguments for the change:

  1) The semantics of trunc() are clear: it maps R -> Z in a specific fashion
  2) The semantics of int() are fuzzy; even non-numeric types
(strings) are handled

Yet there will be a __trunc__ that will allow any chosen mapping to be
implemented, so long as it results in an integer, so (1) is only
guaranteed true for the builtin types. This leaves us with (2) which
seems strongly tied to string parsing (as __index__ resolved the other
common X -> integer case).

I see one main argument against:

  *) trunc() results in duplication at best, zealous deprecation at worst

Given that the deprecation or removal of int(2.3) has been dropped,
the argument is about pointless duplication.


What problem is trunc() supposed to solve if it does to floats what
int() does now? I've done some initial code searches for: lang:python
"int(", and I've seen three primary uses for calling int(x):

  a) parsing strings, such as from a user, a config file, or other
serialized format
  b) limiting the input to a function to an integer, such as in a
calendar trying to ensure it has integer months
  c) truncation, such as throwing away sub-seconds from time.time(),
or ensuring integer results from division

It's unclear to me whether (b) could be better served by more
type-specific operations that would prevent passing in strings, or
whether uses like (c) often have latent bugs due to truncation instead
of rounding.

If trunc() is to clarify round vs. integer-portion, it's something
people learn -- the general lack of comments in (c) usages indicates
nobody considers it special behavior. If it's to clarify the
argument's type (the parsing of strings vs. getting integers from
other numeric types), would separating parsing from the int (and
float) constructors also solve this?

Is the aim to "clean up" the following fake example? (Real world uses
of map(int, ...) seem almost uniformly related to string parsing.)

>>> map(int, ("42", 6.022, 2**32))
[42, 6, 4294967296L]

Not really. You'd have to use an if predicated on the sign to emulate
trunc() using ceil() and floor(). Or something like sign(x) *
floor(abs(x)) -- but we don't have sign().

I don't see much cost for end users at all. It's not like trunc()
represents a difficult concept. Having trunc() in addition to ceil(),
floor() and round() creates a nicely complete set of float->int
conversions. Then int(<float>) can be defined by deferring to trunc()
-- as opposed to round().

My proposal stands (less any talk of deprecation of int(<float>)).

That part is new and represents some progress.  If I understand it
correctly, it means that we won't have both __int__ and __trunc__
magic methods.  That's a good thing.

We can easily add docs to the Real ABC indicating that __trunc__
*should* implement a certain semantics, just like we do (or should do)
for __add__ and everything else.

While this doesn't provide a hard guarantee in the presence of
non-conforming implementations, it's as good as it gets anywhere in
Python. Given that __int__ may be implemented for things that aren't
reals (like dates), it's much harder to prescribe what it *should* do.

To some it's pointless. To others there's a fine point to it.

Case (b) should be using index() instead. Most likely the code either
predates index() or needs to be compatible with Python versions that
don't have it, or the programmer wasn't aware of index(), which hasn't
received a lot of publicity.

But there's a long-standing tradition that all numeric types in Python
accept a string as argument. This was just added to decimal too.

That's an artificial example and hence it is impossible to derive the
intent of the programmer. Heterogeneous lists are pretty rare.

Let me give another artificial example.

Suppose I have a need to implement floats and ints that print
themselves in hex. I can make it so that this property is maintained
across addition etc. without having to change the code that *uses*
these numbers. But code that uses int() to convert a float to an int
will lose the property. If that code used trunc() instead I can
provide a __trunc__ on my hexfloat that returns a hexint. QED.

A single type wouln't need both. But int() should still try both,
because it doesn't make sense for e.g. a date type to have to define
__trunc__ for conversion to an int.

If I'm following this discussion properly, the advantage of trunc() is
that a Real-class-that-isn't-float can define a __trunc__ that can
return an Integer-class-that-isn't-int, right?

In that case, why not have the Real ABC grow trunc(), ceil(), floor(),
and round() methods (replacing the __ varieties), and get rid of the
builtins/math-module functions?

x.trunc() is just as clear as trunc(x), and doesn't require a builtin.

The syntax when used on float literals is ugly ("2.56 .round()"), but
there's no use case for these methods on literals (just write "3").

2to3 could handle this conversion pretty easily in most cases, so
there won't be much breakage.

format() has the same issue, for the same reason:

>>> format(3.9, 'f')
'3.900000'
>>> format(3.9, 'd')
'3'

I never noticed this before, and it's a definite error.  PEP 3101 says 
the valid types for float are 'eEfFgGn%' and an empty string.  I'll 
remove the integer conversion in the float formatter.

Subject: [Python-Dev] Upcoming 2.4.5 and 2.3.7 releases
Message-ID: <479CDB1F.60809@v.loewis.de>

Along with the release of 2.5.2, I would also like to release
new versions of 2.3 and 2.4. These will be security-only releases,
and include a few security-relevant bug fixes that are still being
finalized.

As we don't have the infrastructure to produce full releases of 2.3
or 2.4 anymore, this will be a source release only. As such, it
will likely see less testing than other releases, and users will have
more difficulties in obtaining the software for their system - the
releases will be targeted primarily at system vendors who can chose
to include them as security patches in their system updates.

As a consequence, I would like to roll back all changes from the 2.3
and 2.4 branches which aren't security fixes. In specific cases, the
nature of a change might be debatable; clear security fixes are
prevention of memory corruption and interpreter crashes, clear
non-security fixes are documentation and test-suite changes.

For 2.3, there are only few revisions that would be rolled back:
r52798, r52803, r52824, r54342.

For 2.4, the list is longer; all changes on the branch since
r52382 are candidate for roll-back. I would like to prepare
a white-list of patches that should be preserved; if you think
any of the patches committed in the 2.4 branch is a security
fix, please let me know.

Depends on what you compare to. Compared to int(), the advantage is
that trunc() sends a clear message what its semantics is.

+1. Students just asked me why len() is not a method, and I didn't know
a good answer; the same holds for many other builtins. This is a clear
candidate for a method, IMO.

> The syntax when used on float literals is ugly ("2.56 .round()"), but

Actually, it works fine for float literals:

py> 2.45.round()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute 'round'

It's only int literals which have a problem with methods, but then,
you won't call any of these on an int literal, normally.

Expose an API to clear the cache, and clear it at shutdown?  It 
should probably be part of interpreter shutdown anyway.

In Py2.6, what will the signatures be?
Last I heard, ceil() and floor() were still going to be float-->float.

This is why len() is not a method:

    map(len, list_of_strings)

What I don't know is to what extent this argument still holds in the
presence of listcomps and genexps:

    [s.len() for s in list_of_strings]

However, you still need ``len`` as a function to pass around as a
callback in other cases where you need a generic function because the
type of your data is not predetermined.

In any event, I consider dropping len() from builtins to be gratuitous
breakage, even in 3.0.

Or you just use ``lambda x: x.len()`` for the callback. And a built-in
could easily be created that does what the lambda is doing.

I know for me the reason I always thought the built-ins were there on
top of using a method naming convention for operator overloading was
so that a reasonable default could be provided by the built-in (e.g.,
iter() being able to work with an object that only provides
__getitem__(), on top of its second argument allowing for better
iteration control).

I don't think anyone is proposing that.

When imported from math, yes, for 2.5 compatibility. If we add
builtins, the builtins won't have this restriction.

Well, there's the generic functions line of thought, which isn't quite
dead yet. And there's the idea that the built-in function can check
that the result has a certain type, like len(), which insists on
returning an int.

But mostly it's because I find things like len(x), round(x) and cos(x)
read more natural than method notation. It builds on a long tradition
in math and applied math in programming language -- at least round()
and cos() do, and so does trunc(). IOW it's a matter of aesthetics,
and will never be explainable to everyone's satisfaction.

I disagree with that explanation -- I couldn't know that when I made
len() a function, because map() wasn't to become part of the language
for another 5-6 years.

My explanation is (a) I translated ABC's #x notation, and (b) I like
the way it looks better. Your explanation is at best a handy side
effect. :-)

Good point. I've implemented PyType_ClearCache and exposed it via
sys._cleartypecache(). The function is called during finalization, too.

Can somebody please double check the change? The results are promising
and I'm sure I've implemented it correctly but you never know ;)

|  2) The semantics of int() are fuzzy; even non-numeric types
| (strings) are handled

One could just as well say that the semantics of float() are fuzzy since it 
also handles strings.

The actual claim seems to have been that the semantics of int(<float>) 
itself is fuzzy.  This in turn seems to be based one of two ideas (I am not 
sure which)
a. 'int' might either mean to some people 'some int associated with the 
float input' rather than the more precise 'the integer part of the float 
input', or
b. that some people might think the latter means the same as the former.

Possibility a is easy taken care of by documentation, especially when the 
behavior is what people expect.  Possibility b conflicts with what I 
believe to be both the plain English meaning of 'integer part' and what I 
believe Americans, at least, learn in elementary school.

Moreover, I challenge the notion that 'truncate' is unambiguous.  It simply 
means to cut off, without specifying how much.  '3.141' is pi truncated to 
3 decimal places.  Indeed, it would not be unreasonable to expect trunc() 
to have a second parameter specifying where to cut.

For one data point, I asked my bright 13-year-old for the 'integer part' of 
3.1, 3.9, -3.1, and -3.9 and got the expected 3,3,-3,-3 (as with int()). 
But asking 'truncate' the same numbers or even 'truncate toward zero' got a 
blank stare, which did not surprise me too much as it is not a common 
(American) English word.

I'm not sure we should expose an API to clear the cache, but I don't
have strong opinions either way.  If we keep the ability to clear the
cache, should we also consider some control over the int/float
freelist?  These are worse than the tuple/frame free lists since
int/floats are unbounded.  I suspect the method free lists in
Objects/methodobject.c and Objects/classobject.c don't have that many
entries that could be removed.

There may not be a lot we can do for the int/float caches and I'm not
sure if it's worth it.  We can't move objects once created, although
we could scan the blocks and if there are no live objects in a block,
free it.  That would presumably help with this case:

  list(range(some_big_number))

I don't know how important these things are in practice.

> Can somebody please double check the change? The results are promising

The biggest problem I have with the patch is the attribute name.  I
would prefer underscores.  ie _clear_type_cache instead of
_cleartypecache.  Attributes in sys are currently inconsistent, but it
seems that most of the newer names have underscores.  (Aside: if we
are going to move attrs out of sys for py3k, we should consider
renaming them to be consistent too.  Regardless of moving them, should
we rename them.)

Don't know if this concerns 2.3 but there was a debate whether
including patch #1745035 in 2.4 branch:

Yeah, good idea. The gc module makes sense.

Do the int/float free lists cause any trouble or can they eat lots of
memory? And what about the string intern list?

The attribute name is the least problem. It's easy to fix. Brett came up
with a nice idea, too. He suggested the gc module as the place for the
function.

That's a very good point. I also suspect that for any actual 2.6/3.0 
code base I end up working with there will only be a very limited number 
of abstract base classes that get tested for via isinstance - so the red 
flag for isinstance checks would be types I didn't already recognise as 
being abstract base classes.

I have a working built environment now on windows (turns out it was rather
easy). If time permits, I might have a look at it.

To me, the concept of the "integer part of a float" isn't all that
well defined. It's really a property of a particular representation
rather than the number itself. You think of it as a string of digits
and chop off the part after the point, then turn what's left back
into a number.

If negative floats were represented in two's complement, for
example, then chopping off the digits after the point would give
a result more like floor than trunc.

No, it's probably using the C stdlib routine getpass(). From the man
page:

      The getpass() function displays a prompt to, and reads in a password
      from, /dev/tty.  If this file is not accessible, getpass() displays the
      prompt on the standard error output and reads from the standard input.

So it appears that the official Unix Way prefers using stderr
over stdout for prompting, if using the std files for it at all.

Writing to stdin would be wrong, since it's usually read-only, even
when connected to a terminal.

I hope I am interpreting it correctly, but it seems
http://evanjones.ca/memoryallocator/ explanation on that still applies:

"The worst offenders are integers and floats. These two object types
allocate their own blocks of memory of approximately 1kB, which are
allocated with the system malloc(). These blocks are used as arrays of
integers and float objects, which avoids waste from pymalloc rounding the
object size up to the nearest multiple of 8. These objects are then linked
on to a simple free list. When an object is needed, one is taken from the
list or a new block is allocated. When an object is freed, it is returned to
the free list.

This scheme is very simple and very fast, however, it exhibits a significant
problem: the memory that is allocated to integers can never be used for
anything else. That means if you write a program which goes and allocates
1000000 integers, then frees them and allocates 1000000 floats, Python will
hold on to enough memory for 2000000 numerical objects. The solution is to
apply a similar approach as was described above. Pools could be requested
from pymalloc, so they are properly aligned. When freeing an integer or a
float, the object would be put on a free list for its specific pool. When
the pool was no longer needed, it could be returned to pymalloc.  The
challenge is that these types of objects are used frequently, so care is
required to ensure good performance.

Dictionaries and lists use a different scheme. Python always keeps a maximum
of 80 free lists and dictionaries, any extra are freed. This is not optimal
because some applications would perform better with a larger list, while
others need less. It is possible that self-tuning the list size could be
more efficient."

All this reminds me a lot of discussions we've had when we
needed a new way to spell out string.join().

In the end, we ended up adding a method to strings (thanks to
Tim Peters, IIRC) instead of adding a builtin join().

Since all of the suggested builtins are only meant to work on
floats, why not simply add methods for them to the float object ?!

E.g.

x = 3.141
print x.trunc(), x.floor(), x.ceil()

etc.

This approach also makes it possible to write types or classes
that expose the same API without having to resort to new special
methods (we have too many of those already).

Please consider that type constructors have a different scope
than helper functions. Helper functions should only be made builtins
if they are really really useful and often needed. If they don't
meet this criteria, they are better off in a separate module.
I don't see any of the suggested helper functions meeting this
criteria and we already have math.floor() and math.ceil().

If the intent is really to do a source-only releases mostly for system  
vendors, then I don't see the harm in leaving those changes in.  I  
mean, a vendor is going to cherry pick the ones they want anyway, so  
let's just make it easy for them to do this.  That might mean  
publishing the svn logs a long with the source release, or publishing  
each diff and log message separately.

I would be bummed to rollback the email package changes.

Yes, the explanation still applies. It took me a while to understand how
the free lists are working. Some genius came up with the idea to (ab)use
the op_type field of the PyObject struct to link the freed objects. All
the time I wondered why it assigns something complete different than a
type object to the type field.

In patch http://bugs.python.org/issue1953 I've moved the compact code
from the PyFloat/Int_Fini functions to two new functions and exposed
them as a single Python function gc.compact_freelists(). It doesn't
solve the problem described in the text but at least it gives a user the
chance to free some memory manually.

These changes can be reverted if you like; they were added for
Jython's sake, but it looks like they've now decided to skip directly

But which vendor would cherry-pick those changes for 2.3 or 2.4? I
presume vendors are also in security-fixes-only mode. Are any of the
email package fixes security fixes?

But something should be specified. Users should be able to expect 
consistent behavior. Surely there must be some efficiency reason why it 
is not specified (e.g. it uses a low-level C call that is not 
specified)???

I agree with the idea of putting trunc in the math library since it 
seems to similar to floor.

I like all of your suggestions except the last one. Remember the problem 
with a/b depending on whether b happened to be a float or an int? I 
think you'll be creating a very similar problem here. In my opinion 
int(foo) should do its best to turn foo into an int with *predictable* 
behavior.

The least surprising behavior for int(float) is probably trunc(float). 
Personally I prefer round(float), but I doubt it is worth breaking code 
and retraining everybody.

That's a dangerous generalization from just one example. I'd prefer it

Nowadays, it often is writable I've found, but we still shouldn't assume that.

I cannot find anything explicitly in favour of or against this in POSIX. The
stuff quoted below is what I could find. I do not think there's a hard
mandate either way, but from my experience of having been a committer for
both FreeBSD and DragonFly BSD for a number of years stderr was not
preferred for prompting. stderr was always the domain of diagnostics.

"3.105 Command Language Interpreter

 An interface that interprets sequences of text input as commands. It may
 operate on an input stream or it may interactively prompt and read commands
 from a terminal. It is possible for applications to invoke utilities
 through a number of interfaces, which are collectively considered to act as
 command interpreters."

POSIX defines per utility what stdin, stdout and stderr do. The default
definition for these is:

STDIN

There is no additional rationale provided for this section.

STDOUT

The format description is intended to be sufficiently rigorous to allow
post-processing of output by other programs, particularly by an awk or lex
parser.

STDERR

This section does not describe error messages that refer to incorrect
operation of the utility. Consider a utility that processes program source
code as its input. This section is used to describe messages produced by a
correctly operating utility that encounters an error in the program source
code on which it is processing. However, a message indicating that the
utility had insufficient memory in which to operate would not be described.

Some utilities have traditionally produced warning messages without
returning a non-zero exit status; these are specifically noted in their
sections. Other utilities shall not write to standard error if they complete
successfully, unless the implementation provides some sort of extension to
increase the verbosity or debugging level.

The format descriptions are intended to be sufficiently rigorous to allow
post-processing of output by other programs.

I would like to have an alpha before PyCon. It looks like there are
two release schedules for 2.6: one in PEP 361, and another in PEP
3000. The dates in PEP 3000 look a bit more realistic:

* Early 2008 (pre-PyCon): release 2.6a1.
* May 2008 (post-PyCon): full feature freeze for 3.0 and 2.6.
* July 2008: release 2.6 (final).
* August 2008: release 3.0 (final).

Though it all depends on who volunteers to be the 2.6 release manager.
I'm not volunteering, although I'll continue to do 3.0 releases until
someone tells me it needs to be done in a more professional manner
(probably once the betas start).

I do think that another (final) 3.0 alpha before PyCon would also be a
good idea. This way we can gel the release some more. For 2.6 I think
we'll need more alpha releases after PyCon; I doubt the backporting
from 3.0 (which has only started seriously quite recently) will be
done by PyCon.

While I couldn't locate such a document, it makes sense when you 
consider that if such a process is part of a pipeline you really don't 
want the prompts being handled as input by the downstream processes.

That's why mv and similar utilities prompt on standard error.

I'd be very surprised if you can find a UNIX or Linux shell, for 
example, that prompts on standard output.

Ah, indeed. It looks like Python's prompt indeed gets written to
stderr, at least when stdout is redirected to a file. Oddly, when
stderr is redirected to a file, the prompt gets written to stdout.
This seems backwards then (and not what the shells do -- when stderr
isn't interactive, they don't write a prompt at all).

But fixing it is delicate -- e.g. getpass very carefully makes sure to
write to stdout, not stderr (and to avoid raw_input() and hence GNU
readline). And cmd.py (used by pdb.py) also assumes the prompt should
go to stdout when it is not using raw_input.

I'm beginning to think that, despite the example of the shells, we'd
be better off if Python *always* prompted to stdout (or not at all if
that's not a tty).

I've back ported class decorators (http://bugs.python.org/issue1759).
Two tests are failing and I need some help to solve the riddle.

Several back ports like the bytearray type and the new io module depend
on a back port of the new buffer protocol. Travis, can you please
increase your priority on the port of your PEP to 2.6?

Does it? The gc module is specific to the cyclic-gc system. I don't see that
this method is. If cyclic-gc is unavailable, should this function be
unavailable too?

Sorry, I made a mental typo here:

but from my experience of having been a committer for both FreeBSD and
DragonFly BSD for a number of years stdout was not preferred for prompting.
stderr was always the domain of diagnostics.

It means I'd be sad. ;)

The problem is that I make separate releases of the standalone email
package from these branches, so that means that email 3.0.3 or 2.5.10
will have regressions.

Unless you're offering to also re-apply these changes after you make the
 Python releases <wink>.

No, that doesn't really make sense. If you are in the middle of a pipe,
what good does it do to write the prompt to stderr, yet read the user
input from stdin?

If you really care about processes that run in a pipe, interact
with /dev/tty.

This sounds like a special case that we might consider. Though I also
wonder if it wouldn't be easiest for you to just create separate
branches for the email package rather than rely on the core Python
branching structure and release rules.

That's a good use case - but is that the reason?

I would think that the true historical reason is that when len()
was introduced, there weren't methods in the language. And even
when support for methods was added, many types supporting len wouldn't
easily support methods (e.g. the string type).

You don't *need* it for that; you could also pass around
lambda x:x.len()

It's clear that you need functions for a functional programming style.
However, I would question that typical Python code is inherently
functional, and instead I believe that it could just as well or better
be object-oriented - it's just that Python mandates functions at certain
places.

I wouldn't want to propose removal of len(), no. However, I do think
that adding more builtins (trunc in particular) is bad, especially
when they make perfect methods.

Martin

Releasing the email package from the Python maintenance branches is  
probably insane.

This kind of thing would be less of a problem if the standard library  
were smaller, and the email package only available separately.  It's  
also why some of us want a smaller standard library.

Well, there were methods, but there were no "special" methods, and the
length of a sequence was intended to be implemented in C. The very
first version of the language (used internally at CWI for a while)
didn't even have classic classes -- the only way to add a new type was
to write a C extension.

I think that for certain things (e.g. len()) the functional notation
is just more readable than the method notation, because it provides
more information to the reader: len(x) guarantees to return an int.
x.len() has no such guarantee, it could be an unrelated len method on
an object that has nothing in common with sequences.

No, using trunc(x) makes it clear that the argument and return value
are numbers. Using x.trunc() doesn't.

If they are there primarily to track any changes that you want to
release in the future (i.e. they are the repository of standalone
email package), then a solution must be found, I agree.

Would it help if I branch
branches/release23-maint/Lib/email to branches/email-2.3 ?
Or should I branch the entire release23-maint to email-2.3?
(branches are cheap in subversion)
(*)

It would mean that you have to check in future 2.3 fixes of the
email package into a different branch, and if you run into security
fixes, you need to commit them into two branches (email-2.3 and
release23-maint).

Same for 2.4. For 2.5, bug fixes could be added until that branch
also goes into the security-only mode (i.e. after 2.6 is released).

Please let me know what you think.

Regards,
Martin

(*) other locations are possible as well, such as branches/email/2.3
or /email/branches/2.3

How often do you expect someone to be looking at code where a trunc()
method is being called and the variable could plausibly be both a
number or something else?  (a Google Code search for "def trunc(self)"
lang:python returns 1 hit)

How does the that additional value weigh against the cost of adding
another builtin and trying to explain trunc() versus int() to new
users?

It's all pretty hypothetical at this point. I do think that the
*concept* of trunc() is very easy to understand so the cost to the
user of having to learn it (only when they encounter code that uses it
or feel the need to use it themselves) is negligible.

One thing I'm beginning to feel more and more strongly about is that
round, trunc, ceil and floor all belong in the same category, and
either should all be builtins or should all be in math.

I should also admit that the 2-arg version of round() was borrowed
from ABC, but the use case for it there doesn't map to Python: in ABC
it's the only tool you have for floating point formatting on output,
while in Python the same thing would typically be done with "%.2f" % x
rather than round(x, 2).

Well, it makes sense in the context of the general Unix
philosophy that stdout is for the result that the program
is computing, and therefore shouldn't be polluted by error
messages or other extraneous things.

Also, the Python interpreter itself appears to write its prompts
to stderr, both with and without readline.

What document did this come from? This sounds more like it's
talking about what should be described in various sections of
a man page, not what should be written to the various streams
by a program.

sounds like an out-of-memory message shouldn't be written to
stderr, which I'm fairly sure is not the case!

New idea:

* Drop the existing second argument for round.
* Fold ceil(), floor(), trunc(), and round() into a single function:

   def round(x, mode=):
       if mode==CEIL:
           return math.ceil(x)
       elif mode==FLOOR:
           return math.floor(x)
       elif mode==TRUNC:
           return math.floor(x) if x>0 else math.ceil(x)
       elif mode==ROUND_TO_EVEN:
           . . .

Maybe we don't need a separate function and magic method for every possible rounding mode.

Also, I think there was some discussion of changing round() to use statistician's rounding.  We might as well make it explicit that this is the new default.


Raymond

P.S.  One place to attach the constants is to the function object, so we would write:
   
   x = round(3.1)              # ROUND_TO_EVEN
   x = round(3.1, round.CEIL)
    . . .

Please ignore my last email.  The idea for combining trunc, ceil,
floor, etc was probably just a distractor.

I just realized there's a good solution to this.  The sandbox has an  
emailpkg directory with subdirectories for each of the email package  
releases.  Currently, the actual code gets svn:external'd in from the  
Python branches, but for email 2.5 and 3.0 we should just svn copy the  
branches into here and remove the svn:external definitions.  I'm not  
able to do this right now, but I should be able to do this in the next  
day or so if you don't beat me to it.

Using the above scenario, that would be fine.

So for now, we'll leave email 4.0 external'd in from the Python 2.5  
branch.  When 2.6 is released, we'll svn copy that in like we did  
above.  The only catch is that it would probably be best to rev the  
email package version number in Python 2.6 just to be clear it's a  
different branch.  4.1.0 would be a fine number even if it's mostly  
just a bookkeeping trick.

What do you think of the above?

Message-ID: <bbaeab100801281720k7d121e38tab01227b8f0fb791@mail.gmail.com>

As has occurred since the inception of PyCon, there will be a sprint
on the Python core at this year's conference!

If you will be attending PyCon (or will be in Chicago during the dates
of the sprints), attending the sprint is a great way to give back to
Python. Working on Python itself tends to deepens one knowledge of the
language and the standard library. Plus it is just plain fun getting
to sit around some tables with fellow Python programmers for several
days (the sprint will last four days, but you do not need to attend
all four days to participate).

The sprint is open to everyone of all skill levels. We can always use
help with things from updating documentation to preparing for the next
release of Python 3.0.

On Sunday evening of the conference there will not only be a sprint
intro session, but also a tutorial on how to develop for Python.
Details will be covered from where to look in the code base for things
to some best practices tips.

If you are interested enough to want to sign up to attend, please go
to http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyCon2008/SprintSignups/Python and add
your name and email address. If you have questions you may email me.

Please sign up for the sprint by the end of February as an email on
what you need to do beforehand will be sent at that time based on the
sprint sign-up page.

And if you are not attending PyCon, we will most likely have several
people in attendance on IRC, thus allowing even people not at PyCon to
participate!

Not sure where this is notion comes from. 
Terry Reedy's post provides a datapoint to the contrary.
Besides, there is no problem along these lines that
can't be cured by a better method name:

    f.integer_portion()

Also, if you go the method route, then the API can easily
be expanded to cover all the normal rounding methods:

   f.round_to_even()
   f.round_half_up()
       ...

These are all specific and explicit.

Also, we can take advantage of the ABC mixin capabilities
to automatically provide all of these given one or two of
them as primitives.

I wish this thread could be truncated. It's got me going round and 
round. I'm completely floored, and will doubtless end up barking mad -

Me too. All the arguments have been repeated over and over. It really
isn't worth more energy at this point; I see a use for trunc()
separate from int() and I really don't care if Raymond doesn't see it.
Let's move trunc() to the math module and be done with it, leaving
round() a built-in with both the one- and two-argument versions
intact.

PS. There's something wrong with Raymond's mailer that creates a
thread in gmail whenever he responds. I suspect it's not correctly
adding an In-reply-to header. That makes the thread feel much more
disconnected than most, because often the quoted text is in a
different thread.

Just like set(sequence) is the set associated with that sequence, not
the set part of that sequence, and float('3.14') is the float
associated with '3.14', not the float part of '3.14', etc. Type names
do not normally retrieve pieces of other objects. When there's no
unique or otherwise special instance of a given type associated with
an instance of another type, the first should not take the second in
its constructor. (This does not imply the inverse.)

On the other hand, to retrieve a piece of another object, you do
normally call a member on that object, so I'd have no objections to
changing trunc() and round() (although the second isn't strictly
retrieving a piece) to methods.

> b. that some people might think the latter means the same as the former.

I don't understand this sentence. I haven't seen anyone advocating
trunc() say that "some int associated with" means the same as "the
integer part of".

I'll grant that the behavior is relatively easily learned. It'll take
some more evidence to convince me that it's what people expect, given
that it _looks_ like a type conversion, and many systems implement
that conversion by rounding.

You may understand the same thing from "int" and "integer part", but
that's a learned association that I didn't have before either you or
Raymond brought it up. Among their other differences, "int" is not an
English word.

No more unreasonable than round() having the same second parameter.
And it would be reasonable to default it to "0" as round() does, since
that's the only distinguished point in its range.

You asked a different question than the one we're talking about. You
should have asked your 13-year-old what the "int" of 3.9 was, or, even
better, how to convert 3.9 to an integer. For the first, you'd likely
have gotten the same blank stare. For the second, I expect you'd have
gotten either 4, or an objection that it's simply not an integer and
can't be "converted" to one.

I was going to suggest the same round(n, mode="round_method_of choice") to 
both round and int(), where int is more forgiving for input.  But wasn't 
convinced.

Works for me.

It seems simple enough to just do ...

    from math import round_even as round


This gives me the specific rounding behavior I want without a lot of noise.

It did, it's from the C. Rationale for Shell and Utilities (XCU).

It's only talking about what will be described in the various sections of
the utilities' documentation, yes. But it was the closest I could find to
*anything* explicitly mentioning stdin, stdout, or stderr and their
function.

I could find nothing with regard to prompting or other such descriptions.

So, don't count on POSIX to mandate anything on this (as far as I can tell).

His mails don't have any indication they're a reply at all - not even
so much as a "Re: " in the Subject. Even Outlook Express isn't *that*
broken; I suspect he's not actually using the 'reply' button in his
mailer.

Surely the real issue here is that int() grew up purely as a conversion 
function, and metamorphosed into a type when the classic classes were 
moved into the background.

A brief scan of the 2.4 library (the nearest to hand) shows no uses of 
int() without an argument in the top level modules. There's clearly no 
point calling int() with a literal integer argument, so its uses for 
conversion clearly dominate its use as a pure type constructor.

Raymond, I don;t know why everyone's talking about you as though you 
weren't reading the thread and able to answer questions. Though I *have* 
sometimes wondered why your posts lack attributions for the quotes.


I see from your headers you have, at least some of the time, been 
posting via gmane using "mirapoint webmail direct", whatever that is. 
Perhaps that's the problem?

I like to port bytearray to 2.6 as early as possible. I'd be grateful if
you could port a limited subset of the new buffer protocol within the
next few weeks. bytearray needs:

PyBuffer_FillInfo
PyObject_ReleaseBuffer
PyObject_GetBuffer
PyBuffer_ToContiguous
PyObject_CheckBuffer
PyExc_BufferError

I don't see why. __index__ has a slot because its primary use is to be
called from C code, where slots add a slight performance advantage.
__trunc__ doesn't get called from C AFAIK.

I thought the __trunc__ method only gets called from 
the C code for the trunc() function which is currently
implemented with PyObject_CallMethod(number, "__trunc__", "")
instead of a fast call to a slot.

And if __trunc__ qualifies, what about __format__, which is similar? 
I'm not pushing for it, I just wonder how the decision is made.

I see.

Well, it would bounce around a bit but it would never execute Python
byte codes. I don't see trunc() being all that performance critical.
The cost of adding a new slot is considerable -- for one, *all* type
objects become 4 (or 8) bytes longer.

I see no problem with the email package being maintained in the Python

I'm not sure if it is particularly urgent because of the rarity of  
occurrence, but I discovered a bug that causes httplib to hang  
indefinitely given some rarely-occurring input in the wild.  To  
reproduce:

python -c 'import urllib2; urllib2.urlopen("http:// 
www.hunteros.com").read()'

WARNING: the page was tagged by one of our users and is definitely NSFW.

Again, it seems to occur very rarely, but the behaviour is quite  
painful and the fix trivial (see http://bugs.python.org/issue1966).

Thanks,

Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question - whom are asking?
If me - Python 2.5.2 will essentially do what the maintenance branch
does currently.

We have not worked out any policy on this, but I always assumed we
would only assign issues to people with commit privileges. I quick
check suggests that you don't have them, Jesus. We can give you the
rights to modify issues and set the assignment, but I don't know if
you should be able to be assigned a bug yet.

What do other people think?

Given that everyone is free to work on whichever issues are of interest 
to them (and post comments to the relevant tracker items), I've always 
seen the assignment field as a way to request that a specific committer 
either fix the problem themselves, or review a proposed solution and 
either suggest improvements or check it in.

I think you're right that there isn't really an official policy written 
down anywhere though - PEP 3 doesn't go into that kind of detail.

Cheers,
Nick.

That has exactly been the policy that I have been executing, yes.

As for giving additional rights on a per-user basis - that's tricky
to implement. We have the User and Developer roles in the tracker,
and you get additional rights only with additional roles, normally.

I also agree with Nick as to what the purpose of assignments is.
To indicate that you are working on a specific issue, a message
saying so is enough (which could also include estimated completion
dates, which a mere self-assignment can't).

Martin

Subject: [Python-Dev]  Monkeypatching idioms -- elegant or ugly?
Message-ID: <640554BC-544A-4CB6-BB20-EF544B120954@bud.ca>

+1 on having established Python idioms for these techniques.

While I don't know if there has ever been a formal definition of  
monkey patch, the term monkey patch came from guerilla patch, which  
came from two or more dynamic modifications to a class interfering  
with each other. These modifications were usually made by extension  
code (Zope add-on Products) to upstream code (the Zope framework), so  
I would define a monkey patch only as dynamic modifications made to a  
class with the *intent to change or correct behaviour in upstream code*.

The term has also caught on with the a second definition of referring  
to any dynamic modification of class, regardless of intent though.

I would perhaps call these methods something like:

  * add_method_to_class

  * extend_class

This gives you a better idea of what they do, rather than use a term  
with a somewhat ambigous definition. With monkeypatch_method under the  
definition of "altering existing upstream behviour", I might expect it  
to raise an error if the method I was replacing on a class did not  
exist (e.g. upstream code was refactored so my patch no longer applied).

I'm wondering if anyone has any comment on this issue?  Its currently
impossible to use distutils as documented to build x64 extensions, either
natively or cross-compiled using the trunk and while I'm keen to help fix
this, I'd like agreement on the direction.

Can I assume silence means general agreement on the compromise proposal I
outlined?

Thanks,

Mark

I beg your pardon. My role is recent (a week) and I'm still learning my
way thru procedures and conventions :-).

Current bsddb module in 2.5.1 supports up to BerkeleyDB 4.5. There is
support for 4.6 in trunk (future 2.6, I guess) and I'm working in a
private branch at the moment, since I have no commit access to python
repository. That private version is intented to be merged into python
2.6 by Greg, when time comes.

My guess is that 2.5 branch is still open to more patches than pure
security/stability patches, so "backporting" BerkeleyDB 4.6 support
seems reasonable (to me). If I'm wrong, please educate me :-).

This backport would include also stability patches. For example, I just
solved a memory leak.

Greg, any opinion?.

Beware, new kid in the block! :).

I don't know what's going on there, but it appears to require higher 
permissions than mine to flag the message as miscategorised (I can read 
it when I'm logged in, but I don't see anything that would let me mark

I think you are wrong, sorry pal! DB 4.6 support is a new feature. New
features must land in the development version(s) of Python, that is
Python 2.6 and 3.0. You must change as less code as possible in Python
2.5 to fix a severe problem.

Please read PEP6:

http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0006/

The gist is that point releases are purely bugfix releases, because
adding features lessens code quality and makes it more difficult to
track changes.  The big push to stick with PEP6 came from the mistake of
adding True/False to Python 2.2.1.

I don't like extend because in Java that's how you define a subclass.

Funny, several examples mentioned earlier in this thread actually
check that the method *doesn't* already exist...

Yes, that's the typical approach. After a while, if your patches are
generally good, Greg will trust you and stop reviewing your code in
detail; eventually he will recommend you be granted commit privileges.

No.

Another thing about monkeypatching is that it seems like the best way
to write an extension class where you want half to be in C/C++ and
half in Python.  I'm in the middle of working on such a class and
there are plenty of members that just don't need to be in C++.

Is there a better/preferred idiom for such a thing?  I don't want to
subclass my new class because I want any objects created on the C++
side to also get the python methods.

I think it depends on the nature of the patch. The 2.5 branch already
supports BerkeleyDB 4.6 (since r58345), so I'm not sure what else needs
to be done.

Being new is not a problem in itself. But do please take the extra
work of double- and triple-checking any claims you make. If you want
to become the new maintainer of the bsddb module, you need to learn
how to check out a branch of Python and how to determine what patches
have been applied to it.

Martin

It does that sometimes when the text is very short. The Bayesian filter
needs more training, so just keep reporting messages as misclassified

Have you tried this? I believe it doesn't even work; types defined in
C++ are supposed to be immutable. Try adding a new method to list or
dict.

However the C++ side should be able to create instances of the
Python-defined subclass  as long as it runs in a method, since it has
a reference to the actual class.

I noticed that and I was trying to figure out if I could create a new
metatype which would add a __dict__ and a method (called add_method or
something like that) that could be used as a decorator for
monkeypatching.  I was partly using this as an exercise to learn more
about the Python internals and I'm probably going down a rathole.

This is what I'm currently doing and it does work, but I'm trying to
build my extension type in such a way that it lazily gets initialized
as a python object only if it is passed to the python side of things.
For this object, 75% of the time, it is created and used in C++ only
and I'd like to not pay for the python object creation overhead if I
don't have to.

I am putting PyObject_Head at the front of my class, but only
initializing it if it is passed to python.  I had intended to
initialize the python bits with a C++ type, but I guess I could do it
with a cached module lookup of the python derived type.    Allocation
is really tricky too, so this all may just not be worth the hassle. :)

Anyway, if these types of issues are inappropriate for this forum,
I'll keep quiet.
