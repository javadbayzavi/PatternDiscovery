# PatternDiscovery
Text analysis prototype and all related study. This is just a temporary study and do not preferred for commercial use. 

<B>Description</B><br />
Pattern Discovery is a free software library in the context of text analysis, clustering and a bit of machine learning. The aim of this library is to provide all the necessary functionalities required to connect to a platform-independent datawarehouse and do text analytical functions e.g tokneinzation, wordbag counting and some chart presentations.

The scenario starts with connection to a mailing list (in this case) and fetch the mail contents into a local repository (either in streaming mode). The library has a set of predefined reserved keys (the reserved key can be updated and configured as well) that must be minned in loaded mail contents.
